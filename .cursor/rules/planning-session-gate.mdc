# Planning session gate

When the user is in a **planning, brainstorming, or design session** (e.g. they said "let's brainstorm", "planning session only", or a brainstorming/planning skill is in use):

## Do NOT

- Write or edit implementation code
- Scaffold files, add dependencies, or run implementation commands
- Propose or perform "quick" or "small" code changes "to help"

## Do

- Stay in research → design → plan mode
- Present design (or design doc) and get explicit approval
- After approval: produce an **implementation plan** (e.g. via writing-plans skill) unless the user already has one
- **Only** start implementation when the user **explicitly** says to implement (e.g. "implement it", "go ahead and build it", "execute the plan")

## How to recover if you already implemented

If you already wrote code during what was meant to be a planning-only session:

1. Acknowledge the mistake
2. Offer to: revert the implementation and continue with planning, or treat the code as a draft and now produce the proper plan for review
3. Do not add more implementation until the user has approved a plan and asked for implementation

## Reminder

"Looks good" or "almost good" on a design is **not** permission to implement. Wait for an explicit request to implement or to create the implementation plan.
