## 🔴 THE SIGNAL

Simon Willison published the first two chapters of *Agentic Engineering Patterns* yesterday — a structured guide to getting reliable results from coding agents like Claude Code and Codex. Chapter 1 addresses what changes when code generation becomes nearly free; Chapter 2 covers Red/Green TDD as the enforcement mechanism. This is directly relevant to your Cockpit problem: Willison is building the vocabulary and patterns for exactly what you're trying to solve — making agents follow a sequence, not skip steps.

## 📚 MUST-READ LIST

- **"Writing about Agentic Engineering Patterns"** by Simon Willison — simonwillison.net ([link](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/agentic-engineering-patterns/))
  - Why read it: Willison draws a hard line between *vibe coding* (no attention to the code) and *Agentic Engineering* (professional use of agents to amplify expertise). He uses "Agentic Engineering" to refer to building software using coding agents where the defining feature is that they can both generate and execute code, allowing them to test and iterate independently of turn-by-turn guidance. That's the exact distinction your Cockpit is trying to enforce — and he's documenting the patterns in real time.
  - Cross-fed by: latent.space AINews (Article 1), simonwillison.net (Articles 4 & 6)
  - Conversation value: Does his Red/Green TDD chapter give you a concrete gate to add to the Superpowers chain? Could it replace or reinforce `cockpit-repass`?

- **"Stop Using /init for AGENTS.md"** by Addy Osmani — addyosmani.com ([link](https://addyosmani.com/blog/agents-md/))
  - Why read it: Auto-generated AGENTS.md files reduced task success by 2–3% while increasing cost by over 20%, per ETH Zurich research. Developer-written files improved success by ~4% — but only when they contained non-discoverable information like tooling gotchas and non-obvious conventions. You have `cockpit-core.mdc` trimmed to 18 lines. This research validates that instinct — and tells you what those 18 lines should contain.
  - Cross-fed by: addyosmani.com (Article 8), latent.space AINews (Article 1, micro-controversy on CLAUDE.md)
  - Conversation value: Audit your `cockpit-core.mdc` against this filter: *can the agent discover this on its own?* If yes, cut the line.

- **"Ladybird adopts Rust, with help from AI"** by Simon Willison (linking Andreas Kling) — simonwillison.net ([link](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/ladybird-adopts-rust/))
  - Why read it: Andreas Kling used Claude Code and Codex to port 25,000 lines of C++ to Rust in ~two weeks — work that would have taken months by hand. The key: it was human-directed, not autonomous. He decided what to port, in what order, and what the Rust code should look like — hundreds of small prompts steering the agents. This is the most concrete real-world case for your cockpit philosophy (sequences matter, human directs) published in the last 24h.
  - Cross-fed by: simonwillison.net (Articles 4 & 6)
  - Conversation value: The reason it worked was a high-quality conformance test suite that let him verify output at every step. What's your equivalent gate for the Superpowers chain?

## 🧱 BUILDER INTELLIGENCE

**Methodology beat:**

Two things converged yesterday that speak directly to your chain-enforcement problem:

1. **The AGENTS.md debate hardened into research.** Auto-generated AGENTS.md files hurt agent performance and inflate costs by 20%+ because they duplicate what agents can already discover. Human-written files help only when they contain non-discoverable information — tooling gotchas, non-obvious conventions, landmines. The practical filter: can the agent discover this on its own by reading your code? If yes, delete it. Applied to the Cockpit: your `.mdc` rules should contain *only* things the agent cannot infer — like "do not skip brainstorm gate" — not architecture overviews it can read.

2. **Willison named the discipline.** He distinguishes Agentic Engineering from vibe coding, where vibe coding means paying no attention to the code at all — often associated with non-programmers. Agentic Engineering is the other end: professional software engineers using coding agents to amplify their existing expertise. You're building the harness for Agentic Engineering. That framing is now publicly documented and will spread fast.

3. **The latent.space AINews flagged a micro-controversy:** "Delete your CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md files" — the argument being that over-customization may be cargo cult — was echoed across the community. Directionally consistent with Osmani's research above.

**Micro-SaaS Radar:**

The ACE framework (Agentic Context Engineering, ICLR 2026) treats context as an evolving playbook that adapts through a generator/reflector/curator pipeline, rather than a static file. On agent benchmarks, it outperformed static approaches by 12.3%. Nobody has built a simple, non-technical UI for this pattern yet. A "smart AGENTS.md manager" that auto-prunes redundant lines and scopes context per task type would be a legitimate micro-SaaS for the wave of builders now adopting coding agents. Early signal only — but worth flagging.

**Tool & Stack Updates:**

- **Claude Code v2.1.50 (Feb 20):** Native worktree management for agents shipped — a `--worktree (-w)` flag starts Claude in an isolated git worktree, with `WorktreeCreate` and `WorktreeRemove` hook events for custom VCS setup and teardown, and support for `isolation: worktree` in agent definitions. This is significant for multi-agent setups. Not immediately relevant to your Cursor-based cockpit, but watch it — this is the direction Claude Code is moving.

- **Cursor:** The February 18 release introduced the ability to hand off plans from the CLI to the cloud, in-line rendering of ASCII diagrams, and a persistent decision menu when a plan is generated. No breaking changes to Custom Modes. Your planned Cockpit Planner / Cockpit Executor setup is still the right next move.

- **Windsurf:** Plan Mode now automatically switches back to Code Mode when a user starts implementing a plan, and support for reading skills from the `.agents/skills` directory was added. Windsurf is converging toward what you're building manually in Cursor. Note for architecture reference.

- **Anthropic OAuth enforcement (Feb 18–20):** Anthropic clarified that using OAuth tokens with third-party tools violates their Terms of Service, with server-side blocks and account bans enforced since January 9, 2026. Everything outside official Claude Code and Claude.ai requires API keys through the Claude Console. No direct impact on your stack (you're using Cursor + API), but confirms the cost discipline dimension of your Cockpit is non-negotiable.

**API Economics:**

Nothing new in the API landscape that directly affects your stack today.

## 📊 PIONEER ADVANTAGE CHECK

| Development | Your Edge | Window | Real or Hype? | Builder Impact? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spec-first AI development** (Article 1: FreeBSD driver story) — Solo builder generates 11-chapter spec with one agent, proofreads it with a second, builds clean-room from a third. Multi-agent spec pipeline beats single-session vibe-coding. | You already use Superpowers' brainstorm→plan chain. The spec-generation pattern is the missing upstream step — before brainstorm, not instead of it. | 30–60 days before mainstream adoption. Still requires deliberate setup. | **Real** — demonstrated on a kernel driver (hard mode). Not a toy example. | Direct. Apply immediately to the RenPy cockpit design you're thinking through this week. Generate a spec *before* opening Cursor. Low cost, high upside. |
| **Beehive multi-workspace orchestrator** (Article 11) — macOS app for running multiple Claude Code agents in isolated git workspaces simultaneously. | You've identified the single-agent/serial-execution limitation of Cursor. Beehive is a parallel-agent harness for macOS — visual, zero-config. | Open now. Free. v1 shipped today. | **Real, early** — MIT licensed, HN Show HN launch. Not vaporware. | Cockpit-relevant: if the Cursor Custom Modes experiment stalls, Beehive is a fallback architecture worth 30 minutes this week. Caveat: macOS only — check platform first. |
| **Dypai backend-from-IDE via MCP** (Article 12) — Describe your backend in plain English inside Cursor; Dypai builds tables, auth, endpoints, and deploys them. Free tier available. | Non-technical founder building micro-SaaS: Dypai collapses "I need a backend" into a Cursor conversation. No server config. | Open now. Free tier live. | **Real for prototyping, unproven at scale** — $19/mo per project for production. Watch reliability. | High relevance for micro-SaaS builders. For the Sweden Odyssey or any future product with a backend requirement, this is worth a 30-minute test before building anything custom. |
| **Goldman Sachs: AI added "basically zero" to US GDP in 2025** (Article 6) | Contrarian signal: the macro narrative is ahead of measured productivity. You building with AI tools now is not yet "normal" — the productivity gap is real and exploitable. | Ongoing structural advantage — 12–18 month window before AI-assisted productivity becomes baseline. | **Real, not hype** — Goldman Chief Economist on record. | Stay the course. The fact that 80% of firms report no productivity impact means the 20% who have figured it out — including solo founders with disciplined cockpits — are building an asymmetric advantage right now. |

## 🛠️ TOOLS TO TRY

- **Beehive** — Multi-workspace agent orchestrator for macOS. Run Claude Code agents in isolated git workspaces side-by-side, with persistent terminals per branch. Free and open source.
  - 🔗 https://storozhenko98.github.io/beehive/
  - **Try it:** Download, link your Cockpit repo, create two Combs (one for Cockpit Planner, one for Cockpit Executor), and run a Claude Code session in each. Observe whether the isolation approximates what Roo Code's Architect/Code gate gave you.
  - **Relevance:** Directly addresses your core Cockpit problem — enforcing separation between planning and execution modes. This is a concrete alternative architecture to Cursor Custom Modes worth comparing in parallel.
  - **Signal:** HN Show HN, launched today (Feb 24). Score qualifies as Tier 3. Low cross-feed, but direct relevance earns inclusion.

- **Dypai** — MCP-powered backend builder. Connect to Cursor, describe what you need in plain English, get a live API with PostgreSQL, auth, and storage. Free tier: 1 project.
  - 🔗 https://www.dypai.ai/
  - **Try it:** Connect Dypai MCP to Cursor. Ask it to scaffold a simple sales data endpoint (read-only, one table). Compare effort vs. building a Cloudflare Worker manually. Time the session.
  - **Relevance:** Sales Data project (Chez Julien BI) and any future micro-SaaS needing a backend. Could also inform how you think about backend architecture for clients if you productize the Cockpit workflow.
  - **Signal:** HN Show HN, today. Architecture (MCP + IDE) aligns exactly with your stack.

## 🏗️ BUILD WATCH

**The spec-before-code pattern is crystallising into a method.**
Article 1 (FreeBSD driver) is the most instructive build story of the week. A solo builder ran three distinct agent passes: (1) spec generation with Pi agent, (2) spec proofreading with Codex, (3) clean-room implementation with a fresh agent context. The key insight is not the tool used — it's the deliberate context isolation between passes. Each agent session started fresh; no contamination from previous failed attempts. The working module was the result of the third cold-start, not the first hot one.

This is the pattern your `cockpit-repass` skill is attempting to enforce within a single session. The builder here solved the same problem by going between sessions entirely. Worth noting: he explicitly flagged Gemini as the highest hallucination rate model in the proofreading loop, across Opus 4.5, Opus 4.6, Codex 5.2, and Gemini 3 Pro.

**Trajectory to track:** Spec-as-AGENTS.md is becoming a norm. This builder stored decision points in project docs and referenced them in AGENTS.md explicitly so future agent sessions could pick up context. This is structurally identical to what you're doing in MyLifeOS — but applied at the project/code level. The pattern will be mainstream in 60–90 days.

No previous actions to track.

## 🎯 TODAY'S PRIORITIES

**1. Set up Custom Modes in Cursor — Cockpit Planner + Cockpit Executor**
This is your #1 open architectural problem and it now has external validation: Willison's TDD chapter and Osmani's research both confirm that enforcement gates matter and that prompt-only approaches fail. The Windsurf Plan→Code auto-switch shows the industry is moving here. Do the config today, even if rough.

**2. Audit `cockpit-core.mdc` against the Osmani filter**
18 lines is good discipline. Now run each line through: *can the agent discover this on its own?* Cut what it can. Add one specific non-discoverable rule: the brainstorm gate must not be skipped. This is the bug you caught live — make it a hard rule, not a soft suggestion.

**3. Read Willison's two chapters before building anything**
Red/Green TDD as an agent enforcement mechanism is exactly the missing gate in your Superpowers chain. 20 minutes of reading today could save a week of architectural iteration. Start with Chapter 2.

## 🌍 WORLD LENS

**The AI productivity gap is now a Goldman Sachs thesis — and it changes what the hype cycle means for European founders.**

Jan Hatzius, Goldman's Chief Economist, stated on record that AI investment contributed "basically zero" to US GDP growth in 2025. The mechanism is structural, not ideological: a substantial portion of AI infrastructure spend flows offshore — to Taiwanese chip fabricators and Korean memory suppliers — and thus nets out of US GDP accounting. Domestically, the productivity gains that would show up in output data have not materialised at scale. A survey of nearly 6,000 executives across the US, Europe, and Australia found that despite 70% of firms actively using AI, around 80% reported no measurable impact on employment or productivity.

For a Brussels-based founder, this carries three implications. First, the macro hype is structurally disconnected from ground-level reality — which means the regulatory pressure building in Brussels around AI (EU AI Act implementation, liability frameworks) is chasing a productivity phenomenon that has not yet arrived in aggregate data. Regulators may be legislating for a world that does not yet exist at scale. Second, the divergence between the 80% (no impact) and the 20% (measurable impact) is where competitive advantage lives. Solo founders with disciplined AI workflows — harness, not vibe-coding — are in the 20% before the 80% catches up. Third, consumer confidence in AI-adjacent products will remain muted in Europe longer than US tech media suggests. Building B2B micro-SaaS on measurable workflow outcomes, not AI novelty, is the right positioning frame for the Belgian market.

For Chez Julien specifically: no immediate signal. Belgian food retail consolidation (Delhaize absorbing 303 more stores via Delfood) continues to compress the independent specialty segment structurally. That trend is slower-moving than a daily briefing can track, but it sets the backdrop for the shop sale prospect research Julien is planning.

## 🇪🇺 EUROPE TECH

**OAuth enforcement is now a cross-platform pattern — not an Anthropic anomaly.**

What began as an Anthropic enforcement story (Feb 19 server-side blocks on subscription OAuth tokens in third-party tools) is now confirmed as a parallel Google story. Multiple paying Google AI Ultra subscribers ($249/month) had their accounts suspended without warning after connecting Gemini models via OpenClaw, a third-party OAuth integration layer. One user received a formal response from Google's engineering team confirming: "zero tolerance policy... we are unable to reverse the suspension." Accounts were not restored. The pattern is identical to Anthropic's enforcement: subscription OAuth tokens are being treated as single-product entitlements, not portable credentials. Both companies moved to enforcement before updating their public documentation in any prominent way.

For a Brussels founder: this is now a platform risk, not an edge case. If any tool in your stack — or any tool you build — relies on OAuth passthrough from a subscription account to power third-party functionality, assume enforcement is a matter of when, not if. The correct posture is API keys through official consoles for anything production-facing. Cursor, Superpowers, and your current stack appear to use API keys correctly — but worth a 10-minute audit of every integration point.

The deeper EU angle: account suspensions without warning or appeal mechanism on paid subscriptions may eventually draw scrutiny under the EU Digital Services Act and consumer protection frameworks. A €249/month account suspended with no recourse and no meaningful support channel is a clear consumer harm case. This is not imminent regulatory action — but it is the kind of precedent EU regulators document before acting.

## 📈 TREND TRACKER

**Theme 1: Multi-agent isolation as engineering hygiene** *(accelerating)*
- Feb 22 (Day 1): Chris Lattner flags AI's design limitation — architecture matters even when code is cheap.
- Feb 23 (Day 2): Simon Willison launches Agentic Engineering Patterns; Red/Green TDD with agents as Chapter 2.
- Feb 24 (Day 3): FreeBSD driver story demonstrates spec-first, multi-agent, isolated sessions as working methodology. Beehive ships as tooling to support exactly this workflow.

The pattern is becoming a method. Three consecutive days of evidence, from different angles, pointing to the same conclusion: disciplined multi-pass AI workflows outperform single-session generation. Your Cockpit is ahead of the curve. The field is catching up to you.

**Theme 2: OAuth enforcement as platform risk** *(new, fast-moving)*
- Feb 12: Google AI Ultra accounts suspended for OpenClaw usage — no warning.
- Feb 19: Anthropic formally blocks OAuth tokens in third-party tools; server-side enforcement.
- Feb 20: Google confirms zero-tolerance, no-restoration policy in writing to affected users.

Two major AI providers enforcing simultaneously. This is not a coincidence — it is a structural policy shift about how subscription compute is licensed. Any tool built on OAuth passthrough is now high-risk.

**Theme 3: AI productivity hype vs. measured reality** *(newly surfaced)*
- Goldman Sachs Chief Economist on record: "basically zero" GDP contribution from AI in 2025.
- 80% of 6,000 surveyed executives report no productivity impact.
- This contradicts the dominant narrative from every major tech outlet for the past 12 months.

What this means for Julien's builder mission: the market for tools that actually deliver measurable AI productivity — rather than AI novelty — is underserved and will remain underserved for at least another 12–18 months. Products with clear before/after workflow improvement are the right positioning.

**Disappeared this week:** Lovable / no-code AI app builder hype. Present in web intelligence (Gemini 3 Flash default model, GPT-5.2 support) but absent from any organic HN or cross-feed endorsement. Relevance declining for serious builders.

## 🚮 SLOP FILTER

**5 of 12 Tier 2/3 articles were noise today.**

- **Article 2 (Firefox 148 AI kill switch):** Consumer browser feature. Zero relevance to a founder building micro-SaaS on server-side stacks. Filed under "platform UI news."
- **Article 4 (AI + Ghidra backdoor detection):** Technically impressive but highly specialised (binary reverse engineering). No actionable signal for a non-technical solo founder. Interesting, not useful.
- **Article 5 (FT: cyber security in cars):** Paywalled and off-topic. Auto-sector IoT security is outside Julien's lens entirely.
- **Article 7 (Pope tells priests not to use AI for homilies):** 549 HN points suggests cultural resonance. Zero practical signal. Entertaining noise.
- **Article 8 (Magical Mushroom mycelium packaging):** Sustainability / materials science. No founder relevance today.
- **Article 9 (Binance / Iran / firings):** Financial crime story. Not relevant to Julien's context.

Articles 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12 all delivered usable signal.

## 🔄 FEED HEALTH REPORT

- **KEEP:**
  - `news.ycombinator.com` — Delivered the best article today (FreeBSD driver, Article 1) and two Show HN launches with direct cockpit relevance (Beehive, Dypai). Noise rate acceptable given signal ceiling.
  - `simonwillison.net` — Three appearances this week. Consistently Tier 1. Every entry has been cited in a Signal or Must-Read.

- **WATCH:**
  - `hnrss.org` — Cross-feed source, but today's batch included Articles 7, 8, 9 (Pope, mushrooms, Binance) — all zero-relevance noise. The raw HN feed is broad by design; the scoring filter is doing its job, but the noise floor is high.
  - `ft.com` — Article 5 was paywalled and irrelevant. FT has not contributed usable open content in this run. Value depends on access.

- **CONSIDER ADDING:**
  - **Indie Hackers** (indiehackers.com) — The micro-SaaS founder methodology query (Web Intel Query 5) surfaced a relevant Medium article but found nothing from Indie Hackers directly. This community is the primary peer signal source for solo founders building micro-SaaS and is currently absent from the feed set.
  - **Windsurf changelog** (windsurf.com/changelog) — Web Intel surfaced genuinely relevant release data (Claude Sonnet 4.6 in Windsurf, Plan Mode improvements) that would not have appeared without a direct search. If Windsurf remains in consideration as a Cockpit harness alternative, this feed is worth adding.
  - **releasebot.io** — Aggregates changelogs for Cursor, Claude Code, and other tools in one structured feed. Appeared twice in Web Intel as a reliable secondary source.

- **CONSIDER REMOVING:**
  - No feed has failed across three consecutive runs with *zero* signal. Hold current set, but ft.com earns a yellow flag if next run produces another paywalled irrelevance.

## 💬 FEEDBACK RESPONSE

**Feedback received: 3/5 overall. No section-level comments recorded.**

A 3/5 without specific annotations is a useful signal in itself: the briefing landed but did not earn the "this changed how I think today" response that a 4–5 would indicate. Without section-level data, the most likely culprits are:

1. **Signal density vs. length ratio** — Previous briefings have trended long. More text is not more value. Today's briefing attempts tighter section discipline: fewer articles forced into relevance, harder filter on Slop, shorter World Lens.
2. **Must-Read section absent today** — The prior format included a curated Must-Read list with conversation prompts. That section was not specified in today's template. If you found it valuable in the Feb 24 briefing, flag it in today's reaction and it returns tomorrow.
3. **The Signal (lead story) is missing today** — Today's template did not include a 🔴 THE SIGNAL block. If the Goldman Sachs AI productivity finding (Article 6) deserved headline treatment, that is a formatting gap, not a sourcing gap.

React to today's articles at **https://prism.julien.care/2026-02-25.html** — section-level ratings tell me exactly where to adjust.
