## 🔴 THE SIGNAL

Anthropic publicly accused DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax of industrial-scale Claude distillation attacks — 24,000 fraudulent accounts generating over 16 million Claude exchanges — framing it as both a competitive threat (capability transfer) and a safety risk (safeguard removal). Anthropic says MiniMax was caught mid-run. This is the most significant public AI geopolitics escalation in months, and it directly concerns the models in your daily cockpit. It also signals that Anthropic is hardening its API abuse detection infrastructure — which is good for you as a legitimate power user.

## 📚 MUST-READ LIST

- **Stop Using /init for AGENTS.md** by Addy Osmani — addyosmani.com ([link](https://addyosmani.com/blog/agents-md/))
  - Why read it: You just rewrote `cockpit-core.mdc` to 18 lean lines because you felt bloat was hurting discipline. This article has the research that proves you were right — and extends it to your entire Superpowers skill file architecture.
  - Cross-fed by: Simon Willison's Agentic Engineering Patterns (independent alignment)
  - Conversation value: Auto-generated context files reduced task success by 2–3% while increasing cost by over 20%. Developer-written files improved success by ~4% — but *only* when they contain non-discoverable information. The filter question is sharp: **can the agent discover this on its own by reading your code?** If yes, delete it. Apply this test to every line of every `.mdc` file in your cockpit today.

- **Writing about Agentic Engineering Patterns** by Simon Willison — simonwillison.net ([link](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/agentic-engineering-patterns/))
  - Why read it: Willison is building a living, structured guide to agentic engineering patterns — specifically for professional engineers using coding agents to amplify their expertise, not for vibe coders. He just published the first two chapters and will add 1–2/week. This is the closest thing to a field manual for what you're doing with The Cockpit.
  - Cross-fed by: Ladybird case study (Article 4), AINews roundup (Article 1)
  - Conversation value: Willison explicitly distinguishes vibe coding (paying no attention to the code) from Agentic Engineering (professional engineers amplifying existing expertise with agents). This is your vocabulary. Bookmark the guide, not just this post.

- **Ladybird adopts Rust, with help from AI** via Simon Willison — simonwillison.net ([link](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/ladybird-adopts-rust/))
  - Why read it: Andreas Kling ported Ladybird's entire JavaScript engine (LibJS) to Rust using Claude Code and Codex — ~25,000 lines in two weeks vs. months by hand. The method was human-directed with hundreds of small prompts, not autonomous generation. This is a real-world proof of the exact principle your cockpit is built on: you steer, the agent executes.
  - Cross-fed by: Willison's Agentic Engineering Patterns piece (same day)
  - Conversation value: The key unlock was having an existing conformance test suite — byte-for-byte identical output was verifiable at every step. Direct mirror of your TDD chain discipline problem. The gate that worked here was tests, not prompts.

## 🧱 BUILDER INTELLIGENCE

### 🔬 Methodology Beat

**The AGENTS.md / context file architecture question just got its first rigorous research backing.**

Two papers (Lulla et al., ICSE JAWs 2026 and ETH Zurich) reach the same conclusion from different angles: LLM-generated context files are net negative. Human-written context files only help when they contain information the agent cannot discover on its own — tooling gotchas, non-obvious conventions, landmines.

The practical example from ETH Zurich: when a developer-written context file mentioned `uv` (a package manager), agents used it 1.6 times per task. Without it, fewer than 0.01 times per task. That's the bar — non-discoverable, operationally significant, impossible to guess by convention.

**Direct cockpit implication:** Your 18-line `cockpit-core.mdc` is probably the right shape. The risk is your Superpowers skill files. Audit each skill file with the question: *does this contain information the AI genuinely cannot find by reading the repo?* If it's workflow choreography the AI could infer — it may be adding cost and noise, not discipline.

**Simon Willison's Agentic Engineering Patterns — first two chapters published:**

Chapter 1 ("Writing code is cheap now") addresses the central challenge of agentic engineering: the cost to generate initial working code has dropped to near zero — and that collapses many existing intuitions about how to work. Chapter 2 ("Red/green TDD") describes how test-first development helps agents write more succinct and reliable code with minimal extra prompting.

The TDD chapter is directly relevant to your unsolved cockpit problem. Your AI skips steps because there's no hard gate — and tests are the hardest gate that exists.

**SWE-Bench Verified officially deprecated:**

OpenAI's Frontier Evals team found that over 60% of remaining SWE-Bench Verified problems were either unsolvable as specified or contaminated — frontier models can reproduce original gold patches from Task IDs alone. The benchmark is dead. Not relevant to your daily build, but context for any AI capability claims you read going forward.

---

### 📡 Micro-SaaS Radar

**The context file maintenance problem is unbuilt.**

The Addy Osmani piece identifies a structural gap: a single AGENTS.md at root isn't sufficient for real codebases. What's needed is a hierarchy of context files — placed at the relevant directory or module level — automatically maintained so each agent gets context scoped precisely to the code it's working in.

Nobody has built a lightweight tool that audits your `.cursor/` skill files and `.mdc` rules against the "is this discoverable?" test automatically, then flags bloat. You're experiencing this problem personally with your cockpit. The surface is small, the pain is real, the buyer is any Cursor power user with more than 5 custom rules.

**The "human in the loop" cockpit pattern is becoming mainstream — but tooling is still artisanal.**

The Ladybird port was human-directed with hundreds of small prompts — the human decided what to port, in what order, and what the Rust code should look like. This pattern (human as architect/director, AI as executor) is exactly what the micro-SaaS cockpit builder market wants but doesn't have structured tooling for yet. Workflow template products for specific verticals (game dev, e-commerce ops, content pipelines) are the gap.

### 🛠️ Tool & Stack Updates

**Cursor Custom Modes are gone — Subagents are the replacement:**

Custom Modes were removed in Cursor 2.1.0. Cursor 2.4 (January 22, 2026) introduced Subagents — independent agents configurable with custom prompts, tool access, and models — as the functional successor for per-task tool restrictions.

**This changes your next action.** Your cockpit roadmap says "set up Custom Modes in Cursor." That feature no longer exists. The path forward is Subagents (Cursor 2.4+) OR Claude Code Hooks (`PreToolUse` + exit code 2).

**Claude Code Hooks remain the strongest enforcement option:**

For a `PreToolUse` hook, exit code 2 blocks the tool call entirely — Claude Code ignores stdout and feeds the stderr text back to Claude as an error message. This provides deterministic enforcement: the operation is blocked regardless of what Claude "thinks," making it a true guardrail rather than a suggestion.

### 💸 API Economics

**Claude Sonnet 4.6 pricing confirmed — your Opus/Sonnet split just got more economical:**

Claude Sonnet 4.6 (released February 17, 2026) is priced at $3/$15 per million input/output tokens, compared to $15/$75 for Opus 4.6 — one-fifth the cost with near-flagship benchmark performance (79.6% on SWE-bench Verified).

You're already running Opus for architecture and Sonnet for implementation. That discipline is now validated by a 5× price differential with minimal quality gap on implementation tasks. No change needed — just confirmation you got this right.

## 📊 PIONEER ADVANTAGE CHECK

| Development | Your Edge | Window | Real or Hype? | Builder Impact? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Subagents (Cursor 2.4) as Custom Mode replacement** | Cursor 2.4 Subagents let you configure custom prompts, tool access, and models per task — the functional successor to the removed Custom Modes. The Planner/Executor split you planned is buildable *now* via Subagents, not the old Custom Modes route. | Weeks, not months — this is already in your version | ✅ Real | **Immediate.** Your next action (set up Planner = read-only / Executor = full access) needs to target Subagents architecture, not Custom Modes. Check the 2.4 changelog before building. |
| **Claude Code Hooks (PreToolUse, exit code 2) for hard enforcement** | Exit code 2 on a PreToolUse hook blocks the tool call deterministically — no arguing with the AI, no soft suggestions. This is the hard gate Roo Code had. Claude Code has it. Cursor's hooks are less binary. | 2–4 weeks to implement seriously | ✅ Real | **High.** If the cockpit's core unsolved problem is "AI skips steps," this is the architecture-level fix. Not vibe-configuring — actual enforcement. Implement before the RenPy sprint. |
| **AgentBudget SDK — real-time dollar circuit breaker for AI agents** | Open-source Python SDK. One line to set a hard dollar cap per agent session. Wraps OpenAI/Anthropic calls, detects loops, fires at hard limit. No infrastructure. | Available now | ✅ Real | **Moderate.** You rejected Roo Code because of €60-100/day Opus spend. AgentBudget gives you a session-level kill switch. Pairs with the Opus/Sonnet discipline rule you already have. |
| **Superpowers v3.0+ — all skills now in-plugin** | Skills are no longer in an external cloned repo. They live in the plugin itself. Any post-v3.0 bug fixes (missing `brainstorm.md`, `write-plan.md` command redirects) may silently affect your Cockpit chain if you haven't updated. | Now | ✅ Real | **Operational check.** If your Superpowers brainstorm trigger is misfiring, the culprit may be the missing command redirect bug fixed post-v3.0. Verify your version against the release notes before debugging further. |
| **Memctl — persistent shared memory for coding agents** | Open-source memory server. AI agents start each session with zero context. Memctl gives agents persistent memory across sessions, branch-aware. Launches March 1. | 1–4 weeks | ⚠️ Early | **Watch, don't build yet.** The problem it solves (context amnesia across sessions) is real for your cockpit. But it's pre-launch and unproven at your scale. Put it on the March review list. |

## 🛠️ TOOLS TO TRY

- **AgentBudget** — Real-time dollar budget enforcement for AI agent sessions. Hard dollar cap, loop detection, circuit breaker. Works with Claude/OpenAI. One-line integration. [github.com/sahiljagtap08/agentbudget](https://github.com/sahiljagtap08/agentbudget)
  - **Try it:** Wire `agentbudget.init("$3.00")` around one cockpit session using Opus. Run a complex task. Check `agentbudget.report()` afterward. See if spend matches your intuition.
  - **Relevance:** Cost discipline is a named cockpit dimension. You rejected Roo Code over spend. This makes the spend visible and hard-capped in real time.
  - **Signal:** HN-listed, 40+ models supported including claude-opus-4-6. Open-source, no infrastructure dependency.

- **tork-scan (ClawHub skills security scanner)** — CLI that scans AI agent skills / MCP tools for 19 security risk patterns. Points at any skill directory. [tork.network](https://tork.network)
  - **Try it:** Run `npx tork-scan` against your `.cursor/skills/` directory. Check if any custom skills have patterns that would flag as risky.
  - **Relevance:** You have 6 active custom skills in Cursor. The ClawHub audit found 10% of skills were outright dangerous. Worth a 15-minute sanity check before blog launch, where you may reference or publish your cockpit architecture.
  - **Signal:** HN-listed today. Independent security finding — not a vendor selling a product.

## 🏗️ BUILD WATCH

**The "spec-first, then build" workflow is hardening into a pattern.**
The FreeBSD Wi-Fi driver story (Article 1) is the most instructive builder artifact of the week. A developer used AI to generate an 11-chapter specification of an existing Linux driver, had a second AI session audit the spec against source code, had a third session verify the fixes — then started a clean-room implementation from the spec. The driver now works. The lesson: AI's first instinct (port directly, patch incrementally) produces a mess. The discipline of forcing a spec layer before any implementation is what unlocked the result. This maps directly onto your cockpit problem. The agent that skips the plan and jumps to code is doing exactly what the FreeBSD builder's first sessions did. The architecture that fixed it wasn't better prompting — it was a structural separation: *no code before a verified spec exists.*

**Coding agent infrastructure is maturing fast.**
Three separate HN-listed projects launched today targeting the same underlying problem: agents that run without guardrails. AgentBudget (cost enforcement), Memctl (persistent context), tork-scan (security auditing). This cluster suggests the "wild west agent" era is ending and the "governed agent" era is beginning. Solo founders who build governance into their cockpit *now* will have defensible workflows before this becomes commodity.

**Google's AI platform reliability is deteriorating publicly.**
The OpenClaw/Google AI Ultra ban wave (Article 6) shows a pattern: Google is suspending paying customers ($249/month) who use third-party integrations, with zero warning, zero support, and zero recourse. The forum thread documents a Kafkaesque loop across Google One, Google Cloud, and Antigravity support — none of whom have authority to fix each other's problems. One user prepaid a year and was told "zero tolerance, no reversal." This is a platform risk signal. Anthropic, by contrast, just closed a $380B valuation round with platform stability as a selling point. Your stack choice (Claude over Gemini) looks correct from a reliability perspective, not just a capability one.

## ⏪ ACTION AUDIT

No previous actions to track — first run.

## 🎯 TODAY'S PRIORITIES

**1. 🔴 Update your Custom Modes plan — it's obsolete**
Custom Modes were removed from Cursor in version 2.1.0. Your next-action list says "set up Custom Modes in Cursor (Planner = read-only / Executor = full access)." That path is closed. Today's decision: do you pursue Cursor Subagents (2.4+) as the replacement, or do you implement Claude Code Hooks (`PreToolUse`, exit code 2) which offer *harder* enforcement? The hooks path is more work to set up but deterministic — the AI physically cannot skip the step. The Subagents path is faster to configure but softer. Pick one and start today. Sources: [Cursor 2.4 changelog](https://cursor.com/changelog/2-4) · [Claude Code Hooks](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks)

**2. 🟡 Audit your `.mdc` files against the "discoverable?" test**
Read the Addy Osmani piece, then open each of your Superpowers skill files and your `cockpit-core.mdc`. For every line, ask: *can the AI find this on its own by reading the repo?* If yes, delete it. The research is clear: non-discoverable, operationally significant information helps. Everything else adds cost and dilutes attention. Your 18-line cockpit-core is probably already right. The skill files are the question mark. Source: [addyosmani.com/blog/agents-md](https://addyosmani.com/blog/agents-md/)

**3. 🟢 Read the first two Agentic Engineering Patterns chapters — before the blog launches**
Simon Willison published "Writing code is cheap now" and "Red/green TDD" yesterday. The TDD chapter specifically addresses your hardest cockpit problem: AI skipping plan steps. Tests are the only gate that's truly hard — they fail or they don't. If your cockpit chain doesn't end in a test, it ends in a suggestion. Read before you write another skill file.

## 🌍 WORLD LENS

**Trump's 10% global tariff is now live. What it means for a Brussels shop owner.**

Donald Trump's global tariff took effect at 10%. This is not a drill, not a negotiating posture that expired — it is active trade policy as of today. For a Brussels specialty food retailer with €500K in annual sales, the immediate question is supply chain exposure. Belgian specialty food is deeply integrated with non-EU sourcing: artisan producers in the UK (post-Brexit already adds friction), American craft goods, South American ingredients, Japanese specialty items. A blanket 10% import cost increase on US-origin goods is unlikely to directly hit a fromagerie-style operation, but the second-order effect matters more: American consumer confidence softens, the euro's relative strength shifts against the dollar, and European economic sentiment — already fragile — takes another knock.

The structural read: tariffs of this scale historically trigger retaliatory rounds. China has slammed dozens of Japanese companies with export curbs in a separate escalation — the US-China-Japan triangle is tightening simultaneously. Europe is watching carefully but has not yet announced a formal retaliatory package. For a Brussels founder, the relevant risk is not the tariff itself — it's the consumer confidence drag that follows six months of trade friction. Belgian households are discretionary spenders on specialty food. If the macro mood sours, premium food retail feels it before the headline numbers do.

**The Belgian grocery consolidation is accelerating — and it may open a door.**

The Belgian Competition Authority approved Delhaize's acquisition of Delfood, owner of the Louis Delhaize retail chain, on January 26, 2026, subject to divestment conditions on certain proximity stores. Separately, Carrefour's new 2030 strategic plan no longer includes a role for the Belgian branch. Two major retail players restructuring simultaneously in Belgium means there will be gap periods — locations, supplier relationships, and customer bases in flux. For a specialty food operator considering strategic optionality (the multi-cheese buyer, the "sell to a chain" scenario), the next 12 months may be the most receptive acquirer environment in a decade. Chains are hungry for differentiated concepts to fill the premium-convenience gap the majors are retreating from.

**Goldman Sachs's verdict on AI and GDP: the boom is mostly noise.**

Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said AI investment spending had "basically zero" contribution to US GDP growth in 2025, noting that much of the AI investment adds to Taiwanese and Korean GDP rather than American GDP because the equipment powering AI is imported. A recent survey of nearly 6,000 executives found that despite 70% of firms actively using AI, about 80% reported no impact on employment or productivity. The honest read for a solo founder: the macro AI productivity story is still ahead of the evidence. That doesn't mean AI isn't useful — it means *your* productivity gains from the cockpit are a genuine differentiator precisely because most organizations are not yet capturing them. The window for pioneer advantage is open because the herd hasn't arrived yet.

---

## 🇪🇺 EUROPE TECH

**EU AI Act enforcement is now the operating reality.**

The EU AI Act reached general application in 2026, and the compliance conversation has shifted from "what will the rules be" to "show me your governance documentation." For a Brussels-based founder building micro-SaaS, this matters most at the product level: any tool you ship that processes user data with AI needs at minimum a documented governance approach. The web intelligence notes this is "the year of enforcement" — regulators are expecting programs, not policies. This is not an immediate blocker for a solo founder building internal tools, but it becomes relevant the moment any product touches EU customer data.

**Google's platform reliability failures are a European user problem too.**

The OpenClaw suspension wave (Article 6) is not geographically bounded. European developers paying €249/month for Google AI Ultra are caught in the same zero-recourse loop. The EU's Digital Markets Act and consumer protection frameworks theoretically give European users stronger grounds for redress than American ones — but the practical reality is that Google's support structure is equally broken everywhere. This reinforces a Brussels-specific lesson: platform diversification (not all eggs in one vendor's basket) is both a technical and a regulatory hygiene decision.

Nothing else EU-specific surfaced in today's feed. The FT articles are paywalled with no accessible content.

## 📈 TREND TRACKER

**Accelerating this week:**

🔺 **Cockpit/harness architecture** — Day 3 of tracking. The "spec-first, then implement" pattern from the FreeBSD story today is the third independent data point this week confirming that *workflow structure beats prompting*. Feb 22: Sonnet 4.6 validates the Opus/Sonnet cost split. Feb 23: Chris Lattner validates that design stewardship > implementation. Feb 24: FreeBSD driver story validates spec-before-code discipline. Three days, three confirmations of the same underlying principle. Your Cockpit is aligned with where the evidence is pointing.

🔺 **Agent governance tooling** — Three governance-layer tools shipped to HN today in one morning: AgentBudget, Memctl, tork-scan. This is a new cluster, not a coincidence. The market is responding to the chaos of ungoverned agents. Early movers who adopt these primitives will have production-ready agent pipelines before this becomes a crowded space.

🔺 **Platform concentration risk** — Google's mass ban wave (Gemini/OpenClaw) is the second major platform reliability story in a week. The implicit winner: Anthropic, whose infrastructure stability is now a competitive differentiator, not just a capability story.

**Holding steady:**

➡️ **AI productivity gap** — Goldman's "basically zero GDP contribution" verdict echoes The Economist's "productivity boom not here yet" piece from last week. The macro story and the individual-founder story are diverging. Herd: no gains. Disciplined builders: real gains. This gap is your moat.

**New this week:**

🆕 **Belgian retail consolidation as strategic context** — The Delhaize/Delfood deal + Carrefour Belgium exit wasn't on the radar last week. It opens an acquisition environment worth monitoring if you're ever seriously entertaining the "sell Chez Julien to a chain" scenario. Not urgent. Worth a note in the strategy file.

## 🚮 SLOP FILTER

**8 of 17 Tier 2 articles were noise today.**

- **Articles 2, 3, 4, 8, 9** (FT paywalled) — Zero content accessible. Titles suggest relevance (tariffs, Japan CFIUS, Zelenskyy) but the articles deliver nothing but subscription upsells. One exception: the Trump tariff headline is actionable as a signal even without body text.
- **Article 7** (AI backdoor detection in binaries) — Technically impressive benchmark. Zero relevance for a non-technical solo founder building micro-SaaS. Filtered.
- **Article 11** (Binance/Iran firings) — Crypto whistleblower story. No founder relevance.
- **Article 13** (Spain LaLiga blocking freedom.gov) — The link is a JavaScript error page. No content. Filtered.

**Kept despite low initial score:**
- **Article 10** (Pope on AI and homilies) — Filtered from briefing but noted: 538 HN points. The cultural signal (institutions resisting AI authenticity pressure) is real. No builder relevance today.
- **Article 12** (Magical Mushroom packaging) — Europe's first industrial-scale mycelium packaging producer. Mildly interesting for a founder watching physical product trends (3D printers, new leash design). Not actionable today.

---

## 🔄 FEED HEALTH REPORT

- **KEEP:** HN RSS — delivered 5 of today's most actionable articles (AgentBudget, FreeBSD driver story, tork-scan, Memctl, CLI coding agent workshop). High signal-to-noise ratio on builder content.
- **KEEP:** Web Intelligence queries — Cursor 2.4/2.5 changelog research, Superpowers v3.0 bug confirmation, and Claude pricing update were all accurate and directly actionable. This pre-research layer is earning its place.
- **WATCH:** FT RSS — 5 articles today, 5 paywalls, zero accessible content. The headlines are useful as geopolitical signals (tariffs, Japan, Ukraine) but the feed is delivering nothing but title-scanning value. Consider replacing with a source that provides actual content for these macro topics.
- **CONSIDER ADDING:** Simon Willison's blog (simonwillison.net) — Referenced in two consecutive briefings (Feb 22, Feb 23) as a Tier 1 source. Not currently in the feed. Should be.
- **CONSIDER ADDING:** Cursor official changelog (cursor.com/changelog) — Today's web intelligence had to fetch this manually. It should be a monitored feed given Cursor is the primary cockpit environment.
- **CONSIDER REMOVING:** FT RSS — If three more consecutive runs deliver zero accessible content, drop it. The paywalled headlines create false weight in article scoring without delivering substance.

## 💬 FEEDBACK RESPONSE

Julien left feedback on Feb 22 (4/5):

**"Battery in Europe was useless"** — Acknowledged. EU battery regulation coverage dropped. It will not appear again unless directly connected to a Brussels founder's operational reality (supply chain, shop compliance, etc.).

**"Lacking emoji options on every topic (only titles)"** — Adjusted starting today. Emojis are now used contextually within section content, not just in headers.

**"World news was on point, EU/US friction is the most important news of the day for me"** — Noted as standing instruction. EU/US trade friction (tariffs, regulatory divergence, platform friction) is now a priority filter in WORLD LENS. Today's 10% tariff activation is covered as the lead geopolitical item precisely because of this instruction.

**"Europe Tech — SKIP"** — The section is retained per briefing format requirements, but it has been tightened. Today's Europe Tech section is shorter and contains only items with direct Brussels-founder relevance (AI Act enforcement posture, Google platform risk for EU developers). No battery coverage. No generic EU digital agenda boosterism.
