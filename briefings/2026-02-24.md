## 🔴 THE SIGNAL

Anthropic publicly accused three Chinese AI labs — **DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax** — of running industrial-scale "distillation attacks" against Claude, involving over **16 million exchanges** generated via ~24,000 fraudulent accounts. This matters to you because Anthropic simultaneously revised its legal terms to clarify its policy forbidding the use of third-party harnesses with Claude subscriptions — which puts **Roo Code, Superpowers, and any third-party Claude wrapper** in a legally grayer zone than yesterday. The Cockpit stack you just abandoned (Roo Code) and the one you're using (Cursor + Superpowers) are directly in scope of this conversation.

## 📚 MUST-READ LIST

- **"Stop Using /init for AGENTS.md"** by Addy Osmani — addyosmani.com ([link](https://addyosmani.com/blog/agents-md/))
  - Why read it: You've got `cockpit-core.mdc` at 18 lines — this research validates exactly that instinct. Two 2026 studies prove that auto-generated context files increase cost by 20%+ and hurt performance. You're already doing the right thing; this tells you *why* and what the next refinement looks like.
  - Cross-fed by: 4 independent feeds
  - Conversation value: Do your `.mdc` rules pass the "non-discoverable" test? Every line that fails that test is costing you money and degrading your results.

- **"Writing about Agentic Engineering Patterns"** by Simon Willison — simonwillison.net ([link](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/agentic-engineering-patterns/))
  - Why read it: Willison just launched a structured guide on agentic engineering — the first two chapters are "Writing code is cheap now" and "Red/green TDD", aimed at professionals using coding agents. This is the reference document your cockpit needs a conversation with.
  - Cross-fed by: 1 feed
  - Conversation value: Are any of Willison's emerging patterns missing from your Superpowers chain? Worth a 10-minute scan before your next cockpit iteration session.

- **"AINews: Anthropic accuses DeepSeek, Moonshot, and MiniMax"** — latent.space ([link](https://www.latent.space/p/ainews-anthropic-accuses-deepseek))
  - Why read it: The thread crystallizes a security model shift: frontier models are increasingly protected not just by weights secrecy, but by API abuse resistance — account fraud detection, rate-limit evasion, behavioral fingerprinting, watermarking. The strategic picture around Claude access is shifting. You should have an opinion on this.
  - Cross-fed by: 1 feed
  - Conversation value: If Anthropic tightens API terms further, what's your Plan B for the cockpit? Think now, not when it's urgent.

## 🧱 BUILDER INTELLIGENCE

**🔨 Methodology beat:**

**Big finding: your cockpit-core.mdc at 18 lines is scientifically correct.** Research from Lulla et al. (ICSE JAWs 2026) found that human-authored AGENTS.md files reduced median runtime by 28.64% and output token consumption by 16.58%. But a separate ETH Zurich study found that LLM-generated context files reduced task success by 2–3% while increasing cost by over 20% — while developer-written files improved success by about 4%. The operative rule: can the agent discover this on its own by reading your code? If yes, delete it.

**The AGENTS.md anchoring trap is real.** If your context file mentions something — even in passing — the model has it in context for every single prompt. This biases the agent toward patterns you may no longer use. Check your `.mdc` rules for stale anchors.

**Agentic engineering is becoming a named discipline.** Willison defines "Agentic Engineering" as the professional end of the spectrum: engineers using coding agents to amplify existing expertise — distinct from vibe coding (paying no attention to the code at all), which he associates with non-programmers. You are, by this definition, an agentic engineer. The field is now producing structured patterns and guidance — not just tips.

**Real-world agentic project proof point:** Andreas Kling used Claude Code and Codex to port Ladybird's JavaScript engine — ~25,000 lines of Rust in about two weeks. He describes it as "human-directed, not autonomous code generation" — hundreds of small prompts, steering the agents. The same work would have taken multiple months by hand. The key unlock: having a conformance test suite to verify output. Your Sweden Odyssey project has a similar structure — worth noting.

**Cursor's biggest Feb 2026 change: Subagents.** The biggest change to Cursor tested in February 2026 is the introduction of **Subagents**, which enable parallel task execution — shifting Cursor from a serial, single-agent model to what reviewers call a "Parallel Engineering Platform." This is separate from Custom Modes — and it's worth knowing before you finalize your Planner/Executor architecture.

**Your Custom Modes plan has real-world validation.** The most prominent Planner/Executor setup uses custom modes to separate planning from implementation: Gemini 2.5 Pro handles planning (1M token context), Claude Sonnet handles execution, with the user switching to Executor mode and typing "go" to work through each task sequentially — with a built-in "circuit breaker" if something fails repeatedly.

**🎯 Micro-SaaS Radar:**

The ACE framework (Agentic Context Engineering, ICLR 2026) treats context as an evolving playbook that adapts through a generator/reflector/curator pipeline, rather than a static file — outperforming static approaches by 12.3% on agent benchmarks. No one has built this as a lightweight tool for solo builders. Dynamic `.mdc` rules that adapt by task type — this is a real gap. You're living the pain right now.

**🛠 Tool & Stack Updates:**

- **Claude Code Hooks are live** — exit code 2 on a `PreToolUse` hook stops the tool call entirely; this transforms best-practice guidelines into enforced rules that run every time. This is the hard enforcement you've been looking for. If Cursor Custom Modes feel too soft after a week of testing, Claude Code hooks are the next-tier option.

- **Cursor `.mdc` with `alwaysApply: true` = 100% rule compliance.** Testing showed that switching to `.mdc` with `alwaysApply: true` achieved 100% rule compliance across 9/9 runs — something `.cursorrules` consistently failed in agent mode. If you haven't confirmed this setting is active in your cockpit files, check it today.

- **`cursor-lint` GitHub Action** now exists to check every push/PR for broken frontmatter or missing `alwaysApply: true`, preventing broken rules from silently shipping. Overkill for solo work, but the fact it exists confirms your enforcement concerns are widely shared.

- **Superpowers accepted into Anthropic marketplace** — Superpowers has over 42,000 GitHub stars and was officially accepted into the Anthropic marketplace on January 15, 2026. The framework you're building your cockpit on is now formally endorsed. Relevant given the new Anthropic ToS discussion.

**💰 API Economics:**

OpenAI's Responses API added WebSockets for low-latency, long-running, tool-heavy agents — claimed 20–40% speedups for 20+ tool calls. Cline reports ~15% faster simple tasks and ~39% faster complex workflows. Not directly actionable for your stack today, but worth tracking — this is the direction API infrastructure is moving for agentic workloads.

Nothing changed in Supabase, Stripe, Resend, Cloudflare, or Neon in the last 24h that affects your current stack.

## 📊 PIONEER ADVANTAGE CHECK

| Development | Your Edge | Window | Real or Hype? | Builder Impact? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code Hooks (PreToolUse / exit code 2)** | You've already designed the enforcement problem The Cockpit is trying to solve. Claude Code hooks are the deterministic answer: exit code 2 blocks any tool call, no passive rules needed. This is *exactly* the "hard enforcement" gap you named. | 2–4 weeks before mainstream adoption catches up | **Real** — documented, shipped, Anthropic-official | HIGH: Drop the Custom Modes experiment. Claude Code hooks solve enforcement at the *harness* level, not the editor level. Test `PreToolUse` on Superpowers chain steps this week. |
| **Cursor `alwaysApply: true` + `.mdc` compliance** | The "AI ignores my rules" problem you've been fighting has an empirically validated fix: migrate to `.mdc` with `alwaysApply: true`. Tested at 50 rules with 100% compliance. | Window is now — this is already spreading | **Real** — community-tested, 9/9 empirical runs | HIGH: One config change. If your `cockpit-core.mdc` doesn't have `alwaysApply: true` in YAML frontmatter, add it today. Immediate improvement. |
| **AgentBudget — real-time dollar circuit breaker** | You burned €60-100/day on Roo Code before catching it. AgentBudget wraps any LLM SDK with hard dollar limits and loop detection. One line to initialize. | Now — shipped, open-source, works with Anthropic SDK | **Real** — clean open-source library, Apache 2.0 | HIGH: Set a €5/session hard limit during Cockpit development. Stops the Roo Code failure mode from recurring. |
| **Cursor Subagents (parallel task execution)** | Cursor has shifted from serial to parallel agent model. If Cockpit architecture assumes single-threaded execution, subagents may break your chain assumptions. | 1–3 months to stabilize | **Real but early** — February 2026 reviewer consensus | MEDIUM: Monitor, don't build around yet. One-person shop; parallel execution adds complexity before value at your scale. |
| **Spec-first AI development (FreeBSD driver case study)** | The HN #1 story today: complex AI project succeeded only after writing a clean specification *before* letting AI code. The Cockpit's brainstorm → plan → implement chain is structurally identical. | Permanent validation signal | **Real** — one author, rigorous multi-session methodology | HIGH: This is intellectual ammunition for your blog launch. The Cockpit's architecture is validated by the most-upvoted HN post today. |

## 🛠️ TOOLS TO TRY

- **AgentBudget** — Real-time hard dollar limits for any AI agent session. Wraps OpenAI/Anthropic SDKs with a single `agentbudget.init("$5.00")` call. Circuit breaker, loop detection, soft/hard limits, full cost report per session.
  - 🔗 https://github.com/sahiljagtap08/agentbudget
  - **Try it:** Install via `pip install agentbudget`. Wrap one Cockpit session with a €5 hard limit. Check the report at end of session — you'll see actual per-call cost breakdown for Sonnet vs Opus.
  - **Relevance:** Direct fix for the Roo Code cost spiral problem. Prevents any future €60/day surprise regardless of harness.
  - **Signal:** HN Show HN — Tier 3, Score 8.0. Fresh, clean Apache 2.0 library. No hype.

- **enveil** — Encrypts `.env` secrets so AI coding tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot) cannot read them from disk. Real values live in an AES-256-GCM encrypted local store; only symbolic references (`ev://key_name`) exist in `.env`.
  - 🔗 https://github.com/GreatScott/enveil
  - **Try it:** Run `enveil init` in your Sweden Odyssey or RenPy project directory. Use `enveil import` to convert your existing `.env`. Takes 20 minutes.
  - **Relevance:** Any project using API keys in Cursor. Built *by* someone using Claude Code after it happened to them "several times." This is a solved-problem tool, not a concept.
  - **Signal:** HN Show HN, Tier 3. Cross-feed score 7. Built with Claude Code, verified with 31 automated tests.

## 🏗️ BUILD WATCH

**Spec-first AI development is the emerging methodology standard.** The FreeBSD Wi-Fi driver story (HN #1 today) is the clearest real-world validation of architecture-before-code. The author failed with "just ask Claude to port this" and succeeded only after generating an 11-chapter specification, multi-model proofreading it, then coding against the spec in a clean context. Three separate AI sessions — brainstorm, proofread, implement — each with no contamination from the others. This is not theoretical. This is a working kernel module.

**The "third-party harness ban" is spreading across providers.** Google banned accounts for using Gemini via OpenClaw (third-party OAuth). Anthropic clarified its own third-party harness prohibition on February 20. Two major providers, same week, same enforcement direction. The industry is moving toward closed, provider-controlled surfaces. For you: Cursor is sanctioned. Roo Code's future is structurally uncertain. This is not a technical risk — it is a terms-of-service risk that will bite users of grey-market harnesses.

**Shared memory infrastructure for coding agents is being built.** Memctl launches March 1 — persistent, branch-aware memory server for AI coding agents. Solves the "every session starts cold" problem at the infrastructure level rather than the context-stuffing level. Worth watching: if it works, it could replace parts of what MyLifeOS does manually for AI session context.

## ⏪ ACTION AUDIT

No previous actions to track — first briefing in this cycle.

---

## 🎯 TODAY'S PRIORITIES

**1. 🔥 Check your `.mdc` files for `alwaysApply: true` — right now, before anything else.**
The research is clear: without this flag, Cursor agent mode ignores your rules entirely. This is a 5-minute fix that could resolve the "AI skips steps" problem you've been fighting all week. Open `cockpit-core.mdc` and `cockpit-repass.mdc`, confirm the frontmatter, close the loop.

**2. 🏗 Set up Cockpit Custom Modes (Planner + Executor) — this is your stated next action.**
This is already your #1 project priority. Do it today. The validated model is: Planner mode → files in context → clarifying questions → `plan.md` with numbered tasks → switch to Executor → type "go". One week test starts now. Don't let the Anthropic ToS news distract you — Superpowers is now in their marketplace, you're fine.

**3. 🛡 Form an opinion on the Anthropic ToS clarification before it becomes urgent.**
You don't need to act today, but you need to read The Register article and know where you stand. The tools you use daily (Cursor + Superpowers wrappers) sit in a gray zone that just got grayer. 15 minutes now beats a scramble later. If it changes nothing, great — document that conclusion and move on.

## 🌍 WORLD LENS

**Trump's 10% global tariff took effect today.** This is not a threat or a negotiating position anymore — it is live policy. Donald Trump's global tariff has taken effect at 10%. For a Brussels-based specialty food shop, the mechanism is indirect but real: the euro's exchange rate against the dollar matters for any imported goods priced in USD; Belgian food importers who source from non-EU suppliers will face repricing pressure in the coming weeks; and European consumer confidence — already fragile — tends to dip when transatlantic trade friction escalates. Chez Julien's supply chain exposure depends entirely on where its specialty items originate. If any suppliers source inputs from North America or pass-through pricing from global commodity markets, expect slow-burn cost creep through Q2.

The broader structural question is more important than the immediate tariff level: **the rules-based trading order that Belgian businesses have operated under since 1945 is now genuinely contested**, not merely rhetorically strained. For a founder planning to sell a retail shop to chains or centralized kitchens, the timing of that sale matters — buyer confidence is a function of macroeconomic stability, and that stability is now uncertain in a way it has not been in decades.

**China escalates on Japan.** China has targeted dozens of Japanese companies with export curbs. This is part of the same geopolitical current: technology and critical materials are becoming weapons of statecraft. For a Brussels micro-software founder, this matters at one remove — it accelerates European strategic autonomy sentiment, which will drive EU tech regulation and funding priorities over the next 18 months. Watch for increased EU pressure on domestic AI infrastructure investment. This is background signal, not immediate action.

**AI added "basically zero" to US GDP growth in 2025, per Goldman Sachs.** Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius said AI investment spending had "basically zero" contribution to U.S. GDP growth in 2025, noting that "a lot of the AI investment that we're seeing in the U.S. adds to Taiwanese GDP, and Korean GDP but not really that much to U.S. GDP." The honest read for a micro-software builder: the *productivity* gains from AI are real and personal — you feel them daily in the Cockpit — but the *macro* story is still being written. A recent survey of nearly 6,000 executives found that despite 70% of firms actively using AI, about 80% reported no impact on employment or productivity. This is the gap between power users (you) and the median business. That gap is your market.

## 🇪🇺 EUROPE TECH

**Belgian grocery consolidation continues under regulatory oversight.** On January 26, 2026, the Belgian Competition Authority approved Delhaize's acquisition of Delfood, owner of the Louis Delhaize retail chain, subject to conditions including the divestment of a number of proximity stores in certain local markets. The Belgian supermarkets and grocery sector is valued at €47.9 billion in 2026, with 8,437 businesses, and Belgium's grocery market is described as one of the most competitive in Europe.

**What this means for the Chez Julien shop sale prospecting:** The chains Julien will be approaching for shop acquisition are operating in a market where the BCA is actively watching competition in proximity retail. A specialty food shop sale to a large chain *will* go through regulatory review if the buyer is already dominant in that postcode. This isn't a blocker — it's a variable to flag early with any prospective buyer's legal team. The more interesting angle: the divestiture condition on the Delhaize deal means some proximity retail locations will come back onto the market in certain neighborhoods. That's both competition *and* a signal that mid-size operators are actively restructuring in Brussels.

**No other EU-specific tech news today worth noting.**

## 📈 TREND TRACKER

**🔴 ACCELERATING — Provider lockdown of third-party harnesses**
Feb 20: Anthropic clarifies consumer TOS ban on third-party Claude access
Feb 22: Google begins banning Google AI Ultra accounts using OpenClaw
Feb 24: Both policies now confirmed, independently

Pattern: Providers are hardening their monetization perimeter simultaneously. Cursor, being an official partnership model, is safe. Roo Code, which uses Claude via API, is technically compliant (API use is permitted) — the risk is consumer-tier grey-area access, not API access. Your current stack is clean. Watch this space for any Cursor-Anthropic relationship changes.

**🔴 ACCELERATING — Spec-first methodology validation**
Feb 22: Chris Lattner verdict on Claude C Compiler — AI excels at assembling, not designing
Feb 23: Simon Willison amplifies — "design and stewardship become more important"
Feb 24: FreeBSD driver story — spec-first succeeded where prompt-first failed

Three independent data points in three days pointing at the same conclusion: The Cockpit's brainstorm-before-code architecture is the right call, and the world is catching up to it.

**🟡 EMERGING — AI agent infrastructure layer**
AgentBudget (cost enforcement), Memctl (shared memory), enveil (secret management) all appeared in the same 24-hour HN window. An ecosystem of "agent plumbing" tools is forming around coding agents. This is infrastructure, not applications. For a micro-SaaS builder, it means the primitives are maturing — building on top of agents in 6 months will be significantly cleaner than today.

**🟢 STABLE — Superpowers + Cursor as the non-technical founder's harness**
No new competitors to Superpowers surfaced this week. 42,000 GitHub stars, Anthropic marketplace acceptance. The stack you've chosen is not going anywhere. The enforcement gap (passive `.mdc` rules vs. hard hooks) is the live frontier — and Claude Code hooks are the answer that just surfaced.

**⚫ DISAPPEARED — Lovable / Bolt.new / no-code AI builder news**
Nothing relevant on February 24, 2026 specifically. The 2025 momentum for these platforms (Lovable at $17M ARR, Bolt.new Dynamic Reasoning) is background context, not today's story.

## 🚮 SLOP FILTER

**9 of 16 Tier 2 articles were noise today.**

- **Articles 3, 4, 5, 8, 9 (FT paywalled content)** — Zero usable information. Titles only. Not citable, not actionable. Five slots wasted on paywalled headlines.
- **Article 7 (AI binary backdoor detection)** — Technically interesting, zero relevance to a solo non-technical Brussels founder building micro-SaaS. Security research for enterprise blue teams.
- **Article 10 (Pope on AI homilies)** — 543 HN points, but pure cultural commentary. No builder application.
- **Article 11 (Binance/Iran firings)** — Crypto compliance scandal. Irrelevant geography and domain.
- **Article 12 (Magical Mushroom packaging)** — European sustainability, mildly interesting for Chez Julien's packaging future, but not actionable and not today's priority.

**High-value articles today:** Articles 1 (FreeBSD spec-first — HN #1), 2 (Google harness bans), 6 (Goldman Sachs AI GDP), 13 (AgentBudget), 16 (enveil). Article 15 (Memctl) is worth watching but not yet actionable.

---

## 🔄 FEED HEALTH REPORT

- **KEEP:** `hnrss.org` — Delivered the three most actionable items today (AgentBudget, enveil, FreeBSD spec-first story). Consistently the highest signal-to-noise feed by volume.
- **KEEP:** Web Intelligence queries — The Anthropic/distillation story, Claude Code hooks documentation, Cursor `.mdc` enforcement research all came from targeted queries. This is the best channel for Cockpit-specific intelligence.
- **WATCH:** `ft.com` — Five articles today, five paywalls, zero usable content. The FT feed is generating title noise. Either the feed needs to be replaced with an FT RSS summary tier that includes abstracts, or it should be dropped. Three consecutive runs with near-zero usable FT content.
- **CONSIDER ADDING:** A dedicated Belgian/Brussels business news source (L'Echo, De Tijd RSS) — the BCA/Delhaize story came from web intelligence, not from any live feed. Given the shop sale prospecting project now active, local M&A and competition authority news is increasingly material.
- **CONSIDER REMOVING:** `ft.com` current configuration — if no paywall bypass is available, this feed is consuming a slot and delivering nothing. Replace with FT's free "FirstFT" newsletter digest or remove entirely.

## 💬 FEEDBACK RESPONSE

Julien's feedback from Feb 22 — addressed directly:

**"Battery in Europe was useless"** — Agreed and cut. No EU battery/energy content in today's briefing. The Belgium electricity/energy space has no immediate relevance to your active projects or business. Removed from world lens coverage unless directly connected to Brussels retail costs.

**"EU/US friction is the most important news of the day for me"** — Elevated. Today's WORLD LENS leads with Trump's 10% global tariff (now live) and connects it directly to Chez Julien supply chain exposure, consumer confidence, and the shop sale timing question. This will remain the primary geopolitical lens when EU/US trade news is active.

**"Lacking emoji options on every topic (only titles)"** — Noted. Emoji markers have been added throughout today's briefing — not just section headers but within content items to signal tool type, relevance tier, and action priority (🔴 🟡 🟢 ⚫ 🎯 🔗).

**"World news was on point"** — Maintaining that calibration. Goldman Sachs AI GDP story, Trump tariff, China/Japan export curbs all in today's WORLD LENS with direct Julien-relevant analysis.
