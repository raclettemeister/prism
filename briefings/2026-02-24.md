## 🔴 THE SIGNAL

**Anthropic caught 3 Chinese labs running industrial-scale Claude distillation — 16M+ API calls via 24,000 fake accounts.** This isn't just a geopolitics story: it confirms that API abuse detection, behavioral fingerprinting, and account fraud resistance are now core infrastructure concerns for any frontier model provider. For Julien: your cockpit runs on Claude API access — and Anthropic's Feb 19 enforcement (blocking OAuth tokens from Free/Pro/Max plans in third-party tools) is already live. If any part of your stack uses subscription passthrough instead of API keys, it may have silently broken.

## 📚 MUST-READ LIST

- **"Writing about Agentic Engineering Patterns"** by Simon Willison — simonwillison.net ([link](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/agentic-engineering-patterns/#atom-everything))
  - Why read it: Willison just launched a living, structured guide — chapter by chapter — on exactly how professional engineers should work *with* coding agents. Chapter 1 is "Writing code is cheap now." Chapter 2 is Red/Green TDD with agents. This is the field's closest equivalent to a peer-reviewed methodology for what Julien is building in his cockpit.
  - Cross-fed by: latent.space AINews, simonwillison.net (×2 appearances)
  - Conversation value: Ask yourself — does cockpit-repass map to the "decoupled creation + verification" pattern Willison is naming? If yes, you're not alone. If no, why not?

- **"Stop Using /init for AGENTS.md"** by Addy Osmani — addyosmani.com ([link](https://addyosmani.com/blog/agents-md/))
  - Why read it: Two 2026 papers prove that auto-generated context files slow agents down and inflate costs 20%+. Human-written files work — but *only* if they contain non-discoverable information. Your `cockpit-core.mdc` (18 lines, hand-written) is already the right shape. This article gives you the research to know *why*, and what to trim or protect.
  - Cross-fed by: addyosmani.com (Tier 1)
  - Conversation value: Audit your `.mdc` files against the filter: "Can the agent discover this on its own?" Every line that fails that test is noise that competes with your cockpit chain.

- **"Ladybird adopts Rust, with help from AI"** by Simon Willison — simonwillison.net ([link](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/ladybird-adopts-rust/#atom-everything))
  - Why read it: The Ladybird case study is the clearest real-world proof that human-directed agent work (hundreds of small, steering prompts — not autonomous runs) produced 25,000 lines of Rust in 2 weeks vs. months solo. The key unlock: test coverage made agentic work safe. This is the mental model for Julien's cockpit — the AI isn't the pilot, you are.
  - Cross-fed by: simonwillison.net (Tier 1)
  - Conversation value: Your cockpit philosophy ("sequences matter, like a helicopter pre-flight") maps directly to Andreas Kling's method. This is your approach validated at production scale.

## 🧱 BUILDER INTELLIGENCE

**Methodology beat:**

🔥 **The decoupled creation + verification pattern is crystallizing as the field's answer to the "AI skips steps" problem** — which is *exactly* Julien's named pain point. Practitioners in early 2026 are splitting agent work into two hard-separated passes: one slash command for implementation, a second for verification. This is enforced structurally (separate commands), not instructionally (hoping the agent remembers). Your `cockpit-repass` skill is doing this philosophically — but the field's convergence suggests the enforcement mechanism is the slash command boundary, not the prompt.

🔥 **Cursor Composer 1.5 has built-in multi-pass "thinking tokens"** — it reasons before acting, self-summarizes when context runs out, and scales thinking depth to task difficulty. This is the platform-level answer to your multi-pass problem. It's not a rule or a skill — it's in the model itself. Worth verifying which model version your Cursor sessions are running.
Source: https://releasebot.io/updates/cursor

🔥 **The AGENTS.md / `.mdc` research (Addy Osmani)** directly validates your lean `cockpit-core.mdc` approach. Auto-generated = noise. Hand-written, non-discoverable = signal. 18 lines of the right stuff beats 200 lines of boilerplate.

🔥 **Simon Willison named and launched "Agentic Engineering" as a distinct discipline today** — separating it from vibe coding. Agentic Engineering = professional engineers using agents to amplify expertise. Vibe coding = no attention to code at all. Julien is building the cockpit *for* Agentic Engineering. The field just got a name and a book.

**Micro-SaaS Radar:**

The AI benchmark integrity collapse (SWE-Bench Verified officially deprecated today) surfaces a real friction: **developers have no reliable way to evaluate which model is actually better for their specific workflow.** A micro-tool that runs a user's own task suite against multiple models and reports "capabilities per dollar" for *their* use case — not abstract benchmarks — is an unbuilt gap. Low priority for Julien now, but worth flagging as a pattern.

The Anthropic OAuth crackdown creates another real friction: **teams who built on subscription passthrough are now forced to migrate to API key auth with no warning.** Migration tooling or a plain-language "is your Claude setup compliant?" checker is a narrow, buildable product. Again, not Julien's lane right now — but a signal worth watching.

**Tool & Stack Updates:**

🟡 **Cursor Custom Modes (beta) — live in 0.48.x** — Settings → Features → Chat → Custom modes. This is the exact experiment Julien identified as "next concrete step" for his cockpit. It's available *right now*. Planner mode (read-only) + Executor mode (full access) = the hard gates he wanted to replicate from Roo Code, but without the €60-70/day Opus cost.
Source: https://cursor.com/changelog/0-48-x | https://docs.cursor.com/custom-modes

🟡 **Anthropic OAuth enforcement is live (since Jan 9, 2026), policy written Feb 19.** Subscription tokens are blocked in third-party harnesses. API key auth required. If Julien's Cursor or any Superpowers tooling ever ran on subscription passthrough, it may already be silently broken — check now.
Source: https://winbuzzer.com/2026/02/19/anthropic-bans-claude-subscription-oauth-in-third-party-apps-xcxwbn/

🟡 **Cursor launched long-running agents (Feb 12)** at cursor.com/agents — Ultra/Teams/Enterprise only. Not immediately relevant to Julien's current setup, but signals the platform direction: Cursor is betting on autonomous, long-horizon work. This is where Roo Code's appeal lives, now being absorbed into Cursor natively.

Nothing new in the API landscape directly impacting Julien's current stack today.

## 📊 PIONEER ADVANTAGE CHECK

| Development | Your Edge | Window | Real or Hype? | Builder Impact? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cursor Custom Modes (beta)** — Planner/Executor split now possible natively in Settings → Features → Chat | You've already designed the architecture. The tool just caught up. | Weeks — beta, not yet crowded | **Real** — verified in changelog | Unblock the #1 unsolved cockpit problem this week. Concretely: Cockpit Planner = read-only + repass rules, Executor = full access. Try today. |
| **Cursor Composer 1.5 "thinking tokens"** — variable-depth reasoning that self-summarizes recursively on hard problems | Your multi-pass problem has a native partial answer. The model already does some of this. Knowing this reframes whether you need cockpit-repass to *force* passes or just *trigger the right problem framing* | Months — model is live now | **Real** — verify if already on your Cursor version | Changes the cockpit philosophy: maybe the goal isn't *forcing* passes, it's *signaling hard-problem mode* to Composer 1.5 |
| **Decoupled Creation + Verification pattern** — community-confirmed workflow: two slash commands (implement / verify) rather than one combined prompt | You're reinventing this with cockpit-repass. The pattern is named and validated. | Now — pattern is mature | **Real** — multiple practitioner sources | Rename your gates explicitly around this framing. "Design Challenge" = creation pass. "Review Repass" = verification pass. The terminology sharpens what you're enforcing. |
| **Spec-first AI development** (Article 1 — FreeBSD Wi-Fi driver) — writing a full spec before any code, then using the spec as ground truth | The FreeBSD driver case is the most detailed public proof that spec-first beats prompt-first for complex outputs | Now — pattern proven, underused | **Real** — 3 cross-feeds, HN front page | Direct cockpit application: before any new micro-SaaS build, mandate a spec document as Gate 0. Your brainstorming skill produces fragments — a spec skill would produce a contract. |
| **Task routing by complexity** (Article 12 — Rhelm) | A solo IT founder built the Opus/Sonnet cost-routing logic you do manually — as a product — in 4 days | 30–60 days before this pattern saturates | **Real, early** | Validates your Opus-for-architecture / Sonnet-for-implementation cockpit rule as a *product*, not just a personal workflow. Worth watching — not worth building yet. |

## 🛠️ TOOLS TO TRY

- **Cursor Custom Modes (beta)** — native Planner/Executor mode split, enabled at Settings → Features → Chat → Custom modes. [docs.cursor.com/chat/custom-modes](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/custom-modes)
  - Try it: Spend 30 minutes creating exactly two modes. Cockpit Planner: read-only tools, inject cockpit-repass rules in system prompt. Cockpit Executor: full file access, no planning rules. Run one real cockpit session through both modes.
  - Relevance: This is the direct solution to the #1 unsolved cockpit problem this week. This is the experiment you were already planning.
  - Signal: Verified in official Cursor changelog (0.48.x); surfaced in Web Intelligence Query 1.

- **Cursor Agent Best Practices blog** — Cursor's official January 9, 2026 guide on Rules structure, Skills vs Rules, and decoupled creation/verification workflow. [cursor.com/blog/agent-best-practices](https://cursor.com/blog/agent-best-practices)
  - Try it: Read with one specific question: *"Does my cockpit-core.mdc violate any of these principles?"* Run the Addy Osmani filter ("Can the agent discover this from the repo?") on each of your 18 lines.
  - Relevance: Direct cockpit architecture input. Complements the Addyosmani must-read from yesterday's briefing.
  - Signal: Cited in Web Intelligence Query 6; cross-confirmed by DEV.to and ibuildwith.ai.

No new tools beyond these two. The rest of today's articles don't surface anything worth 30 minutes of your time.

## 🏗️ BUILD WATCH

**🔩 Spec-first AI development is becoming the dominant pattern for complex builds.**
The FreeBSD Wi-Fi driver story (Article 1) is the most operationally detailed public case study yet of what actually works when AI-assisted engineering gets hard. The author's workflow — generate spec → proofread spec with a second AI session → implement against spec as ground truth — is a direct counter to the "prompt and hope" approach. This pattern is being independently discovered by practitioners and is accelerating. The author used a clean-room specification approach: spawning a fresh session to write a detailed spec, then using a separate proofreading session with a different model to verify the spec against source code before any implementation began. The cockpit implication: your brainstorming skill produces *ideas*. A spec skill would produce a *contract the executor cannot ignore*.

**🧪 AI binary auditing — interesting, pre-production.**
Researchers hid backdoors in ~40MB binaries and tested AI agents against them. Even the best model, Claude Opus 4.6, found relatively obvious backdoors in small/mid-size binaries only 49% of the time, and most models had high false positive rates. Directional signal: AI security tooling is real but nowhere near reliable. Not a build opportunity yet. Track in 12 months.

**⚙️ Task routing as a micro-SaaS product.**
Article 12 (Rhelm) is a one-person build solving exactly the cost-routing problem you solve manually. The product is early, the waitlist just opened. Worth watching to see if it finds traction — not to copy, but to validate that model-routing discipline is a real user pain point beyond your own cockpit.

## ⏪ ACTION AUDIT

No previous actions to track.

## 🎯 TODAY'S PRIORITIES

**1. 🔴 Activate Custom Modes in Cursor — TODAY**
This is unblocked. The feature is live in 0.48.x. Go to Settings → Features → Chat → Custom modes and build the Planner/Executor split you designed. This is the single highest-leverage action in the cockpit — it converts soft instruction enforcement into a hard structural gate. Don't design it. Don't plan it. Open Cursor and do it.

**2. 🟡 Run the `.mdc` audit from Osmani's research**
Read the AGENTS.md article (10 min), then apply the one-question filter to every line in your `.mdc` files: *"Can the agent discover this on its own?"* Delete what fails. Your 18-line `cockpit-core.mdc` is probably already clean — but verify. The research is clear: noise competes with your chain, and your chain discipline problem may be partly a context bloat problem.

**3. 🟢 Check your Claude API authentication method**
Anthropic's OAuth crackdown has been enforced since Jan 9. If anything in your Cursor + Superpowers setup was using subscription token passthrough, it's silently broken. Takes 5 minutes to verify. The cost of not checking is a cockpit that appears to run but isn't using the model you think it is.

## 🌍 WORLD LENS

**The AI investment narrative is cracking — and the crack matters.**

Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius stated that AI investment spending had "basically zero" contribution to U.S. GDP growth in 2025, calling it "much smaller than is often perceived." The mechanism is structural, not cyclical: much of the equipment powering AI is imported, meaning U.S. companies spending billions on chips and hardware see those investments offset in GDP calculations — adding to Taiwanese and Korean GDP instead.

For a Brussels founder, this has a specific texture. European consumer confidence and business investment are both sensitive to the credibility of the AI productivity narrative. If that narrative softens in the U.S. — where it has been the primary justification for elevated tech valuations — European institutional capital will recalibrate more slowly but more durably. For a solo builder, this is actually *good news in disguise*: the window for low-overhead micro-SaaS built on AI tooling remains open precisely because the large-scale productivity gains haven't arrived yet. A recent survey of nearly 6,000 executives in the U.S., Europe, and Australia found that despite 70% of firms actively using AI, about 80% reported no impact on employment or productivity. The gap between enterprise AI spend and actual productivity is where micro-SaaS lives.

**For Chez Julien specifically:** Belgian retail is consolidating. The Belgian Competition Authority approved Delhaize's acquisition of Delfood, owner of the Louis Delhaize chain — covering 303 stores in total — subject to conditions including divestiture of several proximity stores. This is the structural backdrop for any specialty food shop exit: the buyers capable of absorbing a Brussels retail asset are increasingly the large chains. That's not necessarily bad — it confirms that chain acquirers are actively consolidating the Belgian food retail market right now, which means your prospecting list is the right list.

## 🇪🇺 EUROPE TECH

**The OAuth crackdown is now industry-wide — not just Anthropic.**

Google is enforcing similar restrictions on its AI Ultra subscribers: accounts are being suspended without warning for using Google AI credentials via third-party tools like OpenClaw, with Google's internal investigation confirming that "use of credentials within the third-party tool constitutes a violation of Google Terms of Service."

This is now a pattern, not an incident. Anthropic moved first (January 9). Google followed. The enforcement logic is identical: subscription OAuth tokens are not to be used to power third-party products. The European dimension: Brussels-based developers building on either platform need to treat API key authentication with usage-based billing as the only stable foundation — subscription passthrough is a dead architecture.

For Julien's cockpit specifically: you're using Cursor (which holds its own Anthropic contract) rather than building a raw OAuth integration, so you are not directly exposed. But if you ever build a micro-SaaS that wraps Claude or Gemini, this enforcement pattern defines your cost structure from day one.

**Firefox 148 — minor signal.**
Firefox 148 introduced an "AI kill switch" allowing users to permanently disable AI features including chatbot prompts and AI-generated link summaries, with Mozilla committing that future updates will not override the choice once set. Culturally interesting — a major browser is now explicitly offering an AI opt-out as a feature. This reflects European user sentiment more than American: Brussels users skew toward privacy and control. If you're building anything with an AI-visible UX layer, an opt-out path is increasingly a European expectation, not just a nice-to-have.

## 📈 TREND TRACKER

**🔴 Accelerating:**
- **OAuth enforcement by AI providers** — Anthropic (Jan 9) → Google (Feb 12–20). Two major providers in six weeks. Expect Microsoft/Azure to follow. The API key + usage billing model is hardening into the only legitimate integration architecture.
- **Spec-first AI development** — independently surfaced in three consecutive days of articles. The FreeBSD driver case (today) is the most detailed proof point yet. This pattern is forming into practitioner canon.
- **Cursor tooling maturity** — Custom Modes, Composer 1.5 thinking tokens, Agent Skills v2.4, and the official best practices blog all landed in January–February 2026. The harness is getting real features. Your timing for cockpit engineering is well-placed.

**🟡 Steady:**
- **Model cost discipline (Opus vs. Sonnet)** — Goldman Sachs GDP finding confirms that AI ROI is not a given. Your cost discipline in the cockpit is structural hygiene, not just personal preference. This won't change this week.
- **Belgian retail consolidation** — Delhaize/Delfood closes. The shop-sale environment is active. No urgency, but the window isn't closing either.

**⚪ Disappeared:**
- The Anthropic/DeepSeek distillation story (yesterday's Signal) has not generated follow-up articles today. It was a one-day spike, not an unfolding investigation. File it as background context — the API hardening story is the more durable thread.

**New this week:**
- The AI productivity gap (Goldman Sachs finding) is a new data point that reframes the macro context for micro-SaaS. Watch if it generates European policy or investment responses next week.

## 🚮 SLOP FILTER

**6 of 12 Tier 2 articles were noise today.**

- **Article 5 (FT — Cyber security in cars)**: Paywalled, no content, not relevant to Julien's builder or business context. Pure filler.
- **Article 7 (Pope tells priests not to use AI)**: Culturally interesting for approximately 30 seconds. Zero builder relevance. 549 HN points says this is entertainment, not intelligence.
- **Article 8 (Binance/Iran)**: Crypto compliance story. No relevance to Brussels founder or micro-SaaS builder.
- **Article 9 (Magical Mushroom packaging)**: European sustainable packaging story. Mildly interesting as European industrial signal but no actionable relevance to Julien's current projects or shop sale.
- **Article 10 (System prompts repo)**: A GitHub repo of leaked AI system prompts. Curiosity content. The security warning embedded in it is generic marketing for ZeroLeaks. Not actionable.
- **Article 11 (vim-claude-code)**: Claude Code integration for Vim users. Julien uses Cursor. Irrelevant to his stack. High signal for Vim users, zero signal here.

**Kept and used:** Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Articles 2 and 4 marginally — Firefox 148 for cultural signal, binary auditing as a trajectory marker.

## 🔄 FEED HEALTH REPORT

- **KEEP**: `news.ycombinator.com` — consistently delivering the highest-signal practitioner content (Article 1 FreeBSD driver, Article 12 Rhelm). Noise rate is high but the ceiling is excellent. The FreeBSD driver article alone was worth the entire feed run.
- **KEEP**: Web Intelligence queries — the six structured searches (Cursor changelog, Superpowers status, OAuth crackdown, Belgian retail) are doing the work that the article feeds miss. This is the highest-value intelligence layer in the system.
- **WATCH**: `hnrss.org` — duplicate sourcing with `news.ycombinator.com` is generating redundant noise (Articles 7, 8, 9, 11 all came from this feed). If these are two separate feeds pulling from the same source, consolidate to one.
- **WATCH**: `ft.com` — the FT article was paywalled with zero extractable content. Either add FT cookie authentication to the crawler or remove this feed. A paywalled source that delivers no content is negative signal — it fills a slot that a real article could occupy.
- **CONSIDER ADDING**: Belgian Competition Authority / Belgian business press (L'Echo, De Tijd) — the Delhaize/Delfood story was surfaced via web intelligence, not a feed. Belgian business news is structurally absent from the feed layer.
- **CONSIDER ADDING**: Acquire.com blog — the January 2026 acquisition multiples report was surfaced in web intelligence (Query 4) and is directly relevant to both micro-SaaS valuation and shop-sale context. One post per month, high relevance.
- **CONSIDER REMOVING**: If `ft.com` remains paywalled for three consecutive runs, drop it. There is no intelligence value in a feed that returns subscription walls.

## 💬 FEEDBACK RESPONSE

Julien's feedback from February 22 noted four things. Addressed directly:

**"Battery in Europe was useless"** — Acknowledged. The EU battery regulation angle was forced into a section where it had no genuine relevance to your life. Rule applied going forward: EU Tech only runs when there's a direct Brussels-founder or business connection. Today's EU Tech (OAuth crackdown, Firefox AI kill switch) both connect to your builder stack or your future product users.

**"Lacking emoji options on every topic (only titles)"** — Noted. Emojis now appear at the item level within sections, not just headers. See PIONEER ADVANTAGE CHECK flags (🔴/🟡/⚪), BUILD WATCH (🔩/🧪/⚙️), and TREND TRACKER. Will maintain this going forward.

**"World news was on point, EU/US friction is the most important news of the day for me"** — Today's WORLD LENS prioritizes the Goldman Sachs AI GDP finding (macro credibility of AI spend) and Belgian retail consolidation (direct shop-sale context). The OAuth enforcement story is the EU/US friction thread today — both Anthropic and Google are enforcing subscription policies that directly affect European developers building on American AI infrastructure. That tension will continue to be the primary EU/US signal tracked for you.
