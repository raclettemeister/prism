## 🔴 THE SIGNAL

🇨🇳⚔️🇺🇸 **Anthropic publicly accused DeepSeek, Moonshot AI, and MiniMax of industrial-scale distillation attacks** — 24,000 fraudulent accounts, 16M+ Claude exchanges extracted to train competing models. The sizes vary significantly: MiniMax is an order of magnitude larger than Moonshot, which is an order of magnitude larger than DeepSeek. This isn't just geopolitics: it directly validates why Anthropic's January 9 OAuth crackdown happened, and it means the API cost/access landscape you're building on is hardening fast.

## 📚 MUST-READ LIST

- **"Stop Using /init for AGENTS.md"** by Addy Osmani — addyosmani.com ([link](https://addyosmani.com/blog/agents-md/))
  - Why read it: You just rebuilt `cockpit-core.mdc` down to 18 lines. Two 2026 research papers prove that instinct was correct — and explain exactly *what* earns a line and what's just noise burning your tokens.
  - Cross-fed by: simonwillison.net (independently flagged the agentic engineering patterns thread)
  - Conversation value: Run your current `cockpit-core.mdc` through the filter: *"Can the agent discover this on its own by reading the repo?"* If yes, delete the line.

- **"Writing about Agentic Engineering Patterns"** by Simon Willison — simonwillison.net ([link](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/agentic-engineering-patterns/))
  - Why read it: Willison is building a structured, chapter-format guide specifically to answer "how do I get good results out of this stuff" — starting with two chapters: "Writing code is cheap now" and "Red/green TDD." This is the practitioner canon forming in real time around exactly what you're trying to solve with the Cockpit.
  - Cross-fed by: latent.space (referenced the same Agentic Engineering framing)
  - Conversation value: Is your `cockpit-repass` skill essentially a manual implementation of what Willison calls "Red/green TDD"? If so, you're ahead of most builders. Worth knowing.

- **"Ladybird adopts Rust, with help from AI"** via Simon Willison — simonwillison.net ([link](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/23/ladybird-adopts-rust/))
  - Why read it: Andreas Kling ported 25,000 lines of a JavaScript engine in ~2 weeks using Claude Code and Codex — what he calls "human-directed, not autonomous code generation": hundreds of small prompts, the human deciding what to port and in what order. Direct proof that the multi-pass, human-steers-agent model you're trying to enforce in the Cockpit is the right frame — not vibe coding, not full autonomy.
  - Conversation value: The unlock was having conformance test coverage *before* starting. What's the equivalent for your next project?

## 🧱 BUILDER INTELLIGENCE

**Methodology beat:** 🔥

Two research findings published today crystallize something important for your `cockpit-core.mdc` work:

LLM-generated context files (from `/init`) reduced task success by 2–3% while increasing cost by over 20%. Developer-written files improved success by about 4% — but also increased cost by up to 19%. The delta is *what's in the file*, not whether it exists. The practical filter: can the agent discover this on its own by reading your code? If yes, delete it.

The anchoring problem is real: if your AGENTS.md mentions something — even in passing — the model has it in context for every prompt. LLMs don't distinguish between "this is what we used to do" and "this is what you should do." Every stale line in your `.mdc` is actively misleading the agent, not just wasting tokens.

On the chain enforcement problem you're actively fighting: a single monolithic file gets loaded the same way every time — a flat instruction set can't condition on what kind of task is being run. This explains *precisely* why `.mdc` rules alone don't enforce your Superpowers chain. The file doesn't know if you're in planning mode or execution mode. Your `cockpit-repass` challenge gates are the right architectural response to this.

Simon Willison's new Agentic Engineering Patterns guide also surfaces the TDD angle: "Red/green TDD describes how test-first development helps agents write more succinct and reliable code with minimal extra prompting." Your Design Challenge gate is essentially a pre-flight version of this.

**Superpowers v4.3.0 note:** A critical bug was fixed on Feb 12 — the `SessionStart` hook was running asynchronously, which silently dropped the `using-superpowers` bootstrap context before the agent's first turn. If you haven't updated, your skills system may have been inert on session start without you knowing it. Source: [blog.fsck.com](https://blog.fsck.com/releases/2026/02/12/superpowers-v4-3-0/). ⚠️ Check your version before this week's Custom Modes test.

**Micro-SaaS Radar:** 🟡

SWE-Bench Verified is being voluntarily deprecated by OpenAI: it's saturated and contaminated, with over 60% of remaining problems found to be unsolvable due to flawed or over-specified tests, and frontier models can reproduce gold patches verbatim from Task IDs alone. The practical consequence: any tool or service that sells itself on SWE-Bench scores is now selling snake oil. The benchmark shift to longer-horizon, open-ended, real-world product building evals creates a gap — no clean "can this agent actually ship a feature?" scorecard exists yet for non-technical buyers. That's a potential product surface.

The Klarna data point from web intelligence is worth filing: Klarna removed ~1,500 micro-SaaS services to give AI cleaner context. The consolidation pressure is real. Implication: the micro-SaaS products that survive are ones that handle one workflow completely, with zero integration overhead. Fits your "tiny, focused tools" instinct exactly.

**Tool & Stack Updates:** 🔴 (Directly affects your week)

**Cursor v2.5 (Feb 17):** Custom Modes were *not* restored. Instead, Cursor 2.5 introduced Plugins, which bundle skills, subagents, MCP servers, hooks, and rules into a single install. The sandbox now has granular network and filesystem restrictions — but these are tool-restriction controls for the agent sandbox, not per-mode workflow enforcement the way Roo Code's Architect/Code mode split worked. The community has been vocal about the gap. Know this going into your Custom Modes test week: you're working around a missing feature, not with one.

**Anthropic's Superpowers status:** Confirmed safe. Superpowers (`obra/superpowers`) was officially accepted into Anthropic's Claude plugins marketplace on January 15, 2026 — it's an *authorized* Claude Code plugin, not a banned third-party harness. Your stack is not at risk from the OAuth crackdown. Source: [claude.com/plugins/superpowers](https://claude.com/plugins/superpowers)

**API Economics:** Nothing new in the API landscape today.

## 📊 PIONEER ADVANTAGE CHECK

| Development | Your Edge | Window | Real or Hype? | Builder Impact? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🔴 Anthropic blocks third-party OAuth harnesses; Superpowers officially in Claude plugins marketplace | You're already on the compliant stack (Cursor + Superpowers). Roo Code abandonment was accidental good timing. | Now — ToS enforcement is live | **Real** — accounts are being suspended without warning | Immediate: verify you're running Superpowers as a Claude Code plugin, not via OAuth token routing. One wrong config = banned account. Zero grace period. |
| 🟡 Cursor v2.5 sandbox tool restrictions replace Custom Modes | Granular network + filesystem controls available now in v2.5. Closer to Roo Code's hard gates than anything Cursor had before. | 1–4 weeks to test | **Real** — but different from what you wanted | Check if v2.5 sandbox controls can replicate your Cockpit Planner (read-only) / Executor (full access) split. May solve the chain enforcement problem via a different mechanism than Custom Modes. |
| 🟡 Superpowers v4.3.0 fixes async SessionStart bug | The bug meant your skills system was silently inert every session start. You may have been building on broken foundations without knowing. | Fix available now | **Real** — verified bug, verified fix | Update to v4.3.0 immediately. If you weren't on it, the `cockpit-repass` skill may have been running less reliably than your logs suggested. |
| 🟠 Google following Anthropic: suspending AI Ultra accounts for OpenClaw usage, zero warning | Ecosystem-wide crackdown on OAuth token arbitrage. Not just Anthropic. | Happening now | **Real** — zero-tolerance, permanent suspensions confirmed | Reinforces your Cursor stack decision. Avoid any tool that routes Google or Anthropic credentials through third-party OAuth. The era of subscription arbitrage is definitively over. |
| 🟢 DeepSeek next model expected next week, trained on smuggled Blackwell chips | If it lands with strong coding benchmarks again, API pricing pressure intensifies. Sonnet/Opus may reprice or offer competitive tiers. | 1–2 weeks | **Real signal, uncertain outcome** | Watch pricing. If DeepSeek R3/V3 drops at rock-bottom prices, your Cockpit cost equation changes again. Don't act yet — wait for benchmark reality. |

## 🛠️ TOOLS TO TRY

**vim-claude-code** — Vim plugin that integrates Claude Code CLI directly into the editor with 22 sub-commands (explain, fix, refactor, test, commit, review, plan) and one-key toggle.
- 🔗 https://github.com/rishi-opensource/vim-claude-code
- **Try it:** Not recommended for you right now. You're settled on Cursor. File this for future reference if you ever want a minimal-footprint fallback cockpit.
- **Relevance:** Cockpit architecture thinking — worth understanding how others solve the harness problem
- **Signal:** HN front page, 24 Feb 2026 — first stable release v1.0.0 — community interest in editor-native Claude integration

No other tools worth 30 minutes today. Quality over quantity.

## 🏗️ BUILD WATCH

**The spec-first AI development pattern is becoming reproducible.** Article 1 (FreeBSD Wi-Fi driver, HN Score: 9.2) documents a solo developer building a working kernel driver by first generating a 10-chapter specification, proofreading it with a second AI session, then building from the clean spec rather than from the existing code. The result: a working FreeBSD kernel module produced with "low-involved sessions." This is the most concrete evidence yet that the architecture pattern — *specify first, build second* — generalises beyond app-layer code into systems programming. For The Cockpit: this is exactly the multi-pass thinking discipline you're trying to enforce. The FreeBSD builder solved it not through harness rules but through session isolation: separate Pi sessions for spec writing, proofreading, and implementation. Worth noting that this was done with Pi agent (not Cursor), but the session-boundary principle is harness-agnostic.

**The "AI added zero to GDP" data point is now on record.** Goldman Sachs Chief Economist Jan Hatzius stated that AI investment had "basically zero" contribution to US GDP growth in 2025, citing import offsets (chips add to Taiwanese and Korean GDP, not American) and the absence of measurable productivity gains. A recent survey of nearly 6,000 executives in the US, Europe, and Australia found that despite 70% of firms actively using AI, about 80% reported no impact on employment or productivity. This matters for the build thesis: the productivity gap is real, not yet captured in macro data, and the window for tools that *actually move the needle* remains open. The opportunity is genuine. The hype around AI-driven economic transformation is, for now, premature.

## 🎯 TODAY'S PRIORITIES

**1. 🔧 Update Superpowers to v4.3.0 before starting anything else**
Your entire Cockpit test this week depends on the Superpowers chain running correctly. The v4.3.0 fix addresses a silent failure where the `SessionStart` hook dropped your bootstrap context asynchronously — meaning your skills may not have been loading at session start. Verify your current version, update if needed, confirm the hook fires synchronously before you run a single Cockpit session. 10 minutes. Do it first.

**2. 🧪 Run the Custom Modes test with calibrated expectations**
Cursor v2.5 confirmed: original Custom Modes (per-mode tool toggles) were not restored. What you're building is a workaround using Plugins + sandbox restrictions, not a native equivalent of Roo Code's hard gates. That's fine — but name it clearly. Design your Cockpit Planner / Cockpit Executor modes knowing the enforcement is soft-by-default, and your `cockpit-repass` challenge gates are doing the actual enforcement work. Run one full Superpowers chain cycle today and document where the AI first tries to skip a step.

**3. 📖 Audit `cockpit-core.mdc` against the Osmani filter**
Read the Osmani piece (15 minutes). Then open `cockpit-core.mdc` and apply one question to every line: *"Can the agent discover this without me saying it?"* You got to 18 lines — you can probably get to 12. Leaner context = cheaper runs + less anchoring to stale patterns. This directly serves your cost discipline goal and your multi-pass thinking problem.

## 🌍 WORLD LENS

**The chip war enters its most consequential phase.**

DeepSeek has apparently trained its latest AI model on Nvidia's most powerful Blackwell chips, despite the US export ban — with the chips believed to be in a data center in Inner Mongolia — and DeepSeek is expected to scrub technical fingerprints of US chip usage before release. This is not a minor allegation. If confirmed, it means export controls — the primary lever of US AI policy — have been circumvented at scale. The geopolitical implication for European founders is structural: the assumption that Western AI labs hold a durable technical lead, protected by chip access restrictions, is increasingly fragile. A DeepSeek model trained on Blackwell hardware, released at Chinese price points, would accelerate commoditisation of frontier AI capabilities faster than current consensus assumes.

China has simultaneously slammed dozens of Japanese companies with export curbs — a retaliatory posture that signals the trade war is no longer confined to US-China bilateral friction. Japan is now an active front. For a Brussels founder, this matters indirectly: European export-dependent manufacturers (machinery, semiconductors, chemicals) face a world in which supply chain assumptions are being rewritten quarterly. Consumer confidence in export-heavy economies — Germany foremost — will be pressured. Belgium's economy, tied to Antwerp port flows and European distribution, is not insulated.

**Belgian retail is in flux — relevant to the shop sale thesis.**

Despite modest growth of 0.8% in 2025, Carrefour CEO Alexandre Bompard no longer sees a major role for Carrefour Belgium in his new strategic plan, with Carrefour saying it will keep "all strategic options" open for Belgium. Albert Heijn has been cited as having "already shown interest in the past." A Carrefour Belgium sale — potentially to a Dutch operator — would reshape the Belgian food retail landscape meaningfully. Centralised kitchen procurement, private label expansion, and consolidation pressure on specialty food suppliers typically follow such ownership transitions. If Carrefour Belgium is absorbed by a Dutch operator with different supplier relationships, the landscape for specialty food producers and shop operators shifts. Worth monitoring as a background variable on the Chez Julien sale thesis.

Delhaize is set to open seven new supermarkets across Belgium in early 2026, signalling continued investment in Belgian food retail even as Carrefour retrenches. Net effect: the Belgian consumer food market is not contracting, but consolidating around stronger operators.

## 🇪🇺 EUROPE TECH

**The third-party harness crackdown is now a cross-platform policy, not an Anthropic idiosyncrasy.**

Article 2 makes this unambiguous: Google confirmed in writing that "the use of your credentials within the third-party tool 'open claw' for testing purposes constitutes a violation of the Google Terms of Service," citing "use of Antigravity servers to power a non-Antigravity product," and stated this falls under a zero tolerance policy with no possibility of reversal. Anthropic, Google, and by inference OpenAI are all converging on the same enforcement posture: subscription OAuth credentials are for first-party surfaces only. The token arbitrage window — which powered the Roo Code cost model you exploited briefly — is closed industry-wide.

For a Brussels micro-founder building on AI APIs: the risk is not just cost, it is account termination without warning or appeal. Multiple users reported being locked out of paid accounts ($249/month) with no acknowledgement through official channels for days, and one user who posted a polite question on the forum asking for clarification had their forum account banned shortly after. This is not a customer-service culture that will protect small operators. Build your stack on official API access with billing, not on subscription OAuth routing, and treat that as a non-negotiable architectural decision.

**Ratz food market — Brussels context.**

Ratz, presenting itself as the largest food market in Belgium, opened in the Brussels municipality of Ixelles at 25 Rue Saint-Boniface on 19 February 2026, after 12 months of renovation of a former parking lot, spanning three floors and 3,000 square meters. This is local colour with mild relevance: food culture infrastructure in Brussels is expanding. A 3,000 sqm food hall in Ixelles, positioned as experiential rather than transactional, is a different competitive vector from supermarket consolidation — but it shapes what "specialty food" means to Brussels consumers.

## 📈 TREND TRACKER

**Accelerating this week:**
- **Platform enforcement of AI subscription ToS** — From Anthropic (Jan 9 technical block, Feb 19 documentation) to Google (Feb 12–20 mass suspensions), the enforcement window compressed from weeks to days. The trend line points toward automated, real-time blocking with no human review. Accelerating fast.
- **Spec-first AI development** — The FreeBSD driver article joins the Claude C Compiler (Feb 23) and Willison's agentic engineering patterns post (Feb 23) as a third data point in one week. The "specify, then build" pattern is becoming the practitioner consensus. Not yet mainstream. Still early.
- **DeepSeek anticipation cycle** — All three major Western labs visibly preparing for a new DeepSeek release. This is the second such cycle (first: Jan 2025). The pattern is now established: pre-release posturing from incumbents, then a benchmark shock, then rapid repricing. Expect next week.

**Stable / ongoing:**
- Cockpit enforcement problem (AI skipping chain steps) — no new external solutions surfaced. Still your problem to solve internally with Cursor Custom Modes experiment.
- Belgian retail consolidation — slow-moving, structural. Carrefour Belgium situation has been building for months.

**New this week:**
- Goldman Sachs "AI added zero to GDP" — first major bank economist on record with this. Likely to attract significant media follow-on next week.
- Cross-platform OAuth crackdown confirmed (both Anthropic and Google in same 2-week window)

**Disappeared:**
- EUROPE TECH battery/energy angle (correctly identified as low-relevance to Julien in Feb 22 feedback) — not surfaced today.

## 🚮 SLOP FILTER

**6 of 12 Tier 2 articles were noise today.**

- **Article 3** (China export curbs on Japanese companies, FT) — Paywalled. Zero readable content. Included for headline only; moved to WORLD LENS as background context.
- **Article 5** (AI + Ghidra binary backdoor detection) — Technically interesting, zero relevance to a non-technical founder building micro-SaaS. Security research for reverse engineers.
- **Article 6** (Cyber security threat in cars, FT) — Paywalled and off-topic.
- **Article 7** (Japanese CFIUS equivalent, FT) — Paywalled. Geopolitical background noise, no Brussels founder lens available.
- **Article 9** (Binance fired employees / Iran crypto) — Financial crime story. No founder relevance.
- **Article 10** (Magical Mushroom mycelium packaging) — Pure marketing content. Zero relevance.

**Kept but noted:**
- **Article 8** (Pope tells priests not to use AI for homilies) — 549 HN points, 435 comments. Cultural signal worth one sentence: institutional resistance to AI is now reaching religious leadership. Relevant to blog content thinking if Julien writes about AI adoption curves.

## 🔄 FEED HEALTH REPORT

**KEEP:**
- `the-decoder.com` — DeepSeek / competitive AI landscape. Consistently useful, well-sourced, no paywall friction.
- `simonwillison.net` — Remains Tier 1 signal. Agentic engineering patterns piece (Feb 23) and Claude C Compiler commentary (Feb 22) both directly relevant. Signal density unusually high this week.
- `retaildetail.eu` — Belgian retail coverage is precise and actionable. Carrefour Belgium and Ratz market both surfaced here.

**WATCH:**
- `ft.com` — 3 articles this run, all paywalled, all zero readable content. The FT delivers headlines but no substance without a subscription. Consider whether the feed adds value or just noise volume.
- `hnrss.org` — High volume, variable quality. Today: 1 excellent (FreeBSD driver), 1 directly relevant (Google/OpenClaw), 4 filtered as noise. HN quality is article-dependent, not feed-dependent. Keep but filter aggressively.

**CONSIDER ADDING:**
- `retaildetail.eu` (if not already a primary feed — it punched above its weight today)
- A direct Cursor changelog feed (cursor.com/changelog) — Web intelligence had to reconstruct v2.5 details from third parties. The primary source would be cleaner.
- `blog.fsck.com` — Jesse Vincent's Superpowers release notes. v4.3.0 bug fix was critical information that came via web intelligence, not feed.

**CONSIDER REMOVING:**
- `ft.com` — Three consecutive runs with paywalled content and no extractable signal. Either acquire a subscription or drop the feed. Currently it contributes headline noise and zero analytical substance.

## 💬 FEEDBACK RESPONSE

Julien's feedback from Feb 22 received and acted on. Specific responses:

**"Battery in Europe was useless"** — Agreed. The EU battery regulation angle was generic sustainability policy with no direct impact on a Brussels food founder or micro-SaaS builder. Dropped from EUROPE TECH framing going forward. The European tech section will now filter harder: only EU tech or regulation with *direct* operational relevance to your stack or your market.

**"Lacking emoji options on every topic (only titles)"** — Noted. Emojis have been added as inline markers within section content today (🔴🟡🟢🟠) to signal priority and sentiment at the item level, not just at section headers. Will calibrate further based on your reaction to today's format.

**"World news was on point, EU/US friction is the most important news of the day for me"** — Confirmed as primary lens. Today's WORLD LENS leads with the chip war / DeepSeek smuggling story precisely because it is the structural EU/US/China friction axis. The Belgian retail consolidation angle (Carrefour/Albert Heijn) is the domestic expression of the same globalisation-in-reverse dynamic. Both treated as high-priority today.
