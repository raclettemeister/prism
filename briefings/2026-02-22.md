## 🔴 THE SIGNAL

**Your instinct about Sonnet is now benchmark-validated — and the Cockpit discipline you wrote yesterday is provably correct.**

Claude Sonnet 4.6 scored 79.6% on SWE-bench (real-world coding) — nearly identical to Opus 4.6's 80.8% — and 72.5% on OSWorld (computer use), essentially tied with Opus 4.6's 72.7%, while costing $3/$15 per million input/output tokens — 5× cheaper than Opus. The rule you wrote in The Cockpit yesterday — *Opus for architecture, Sonnet for implementation* — is the exact industry consensus as of this morning. You didn't guess it. You landed on it independently.

## 📚 MUST-READ LIST

- **"How I think about Codex"** by Gabriel Chua (via Simon Willison) — simonwillison.net (https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/22/how-i-think-about-codex/)
  - **Why read it:** Gabriel Chua (OpenAI Developer Experience) breaks down the exact framework: *Codex = Model + Harness + Surfaces*, where the harness is the "collection of instructions and tools." This is precisely what Roo Code is to Claude for you — a harness. This article will sharpen how you think about and talk about The Cockpit as a *harness*, not just a checklist.
  - **Cross-fed by:** simonwillison.net (Tier 1)
  - **Conversation value:** How you describe The Cockpit publicly on launch day. "I'm building a harness for AI-assisted software development" is a sharper, more credible frame than "I use AI to code."

- **"The AI Productivity Boom Is Not Here (Yet)"** — The Economist (https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2026/02/22/the-ai-productivity-boom-is-not-here-yet)
  - **Why read it:** The counternarrative to AI hype, from the most measured mainstream source. If you're publishing The Dishwasher Generation on Substack today to an audience that ranges from skeptics to true believers, knowing this argument cold lets you position yourself as someone who *uses* AI rather than someone who *believes* in it.
  - **Cross-fed by:** economist.com (Tier 1)
  - **Conversation value:** Decide today whether your Substack voice is bullish, skeptical, or practitioner-honest. This article is the sharpest foil available.

## 🧱 BUILDER INTELLIGENCE

**Methodology beat:**

Gabriel Chua confirms that Codex models are trained *in the presence of the harness* — meaning tool use, execution loops, compaction, and iterative verification "aren't bolted-on behaviors — they're part of how the model learns to operate." The practical implication: the model and the harness co-evolve. This is why Roo Code isn't just a UI — it actively shapes the output quality of Claude in ways that raw API access doesn't. Your Cockpit is building on top of this architecture, whether you knew it or not.

Separately: Cursor shipped Subagents in February 2026 — previously, AI coding agents worked serially (read file → think → write code → run terminal command); the new architecture enables parallel processing. This is not urgent for you today, but it's the direction The Cockpit v1.0 points toward. File it for when you spec the second game.

**Micro-SaaS Radar:**

A key distribution tactic for solopreneurs in early 2026 is the "48-Hour Distribution Hack" — launching a landing page with a "Buy Now" button immediately, since tracking clicks on a price tag is considered the most reliable public validation signal. This applies directly to how you position julien.care post-launch: if you add any paid offering, put the button there on day one, not week four.

Substack Live is described as "the highest-leverage growth tool on the platform right now" — since Live sessions push notifications to an entire subscriber list with no algorithm barrier, and Substack auto-generates clips from them. For The Dishwasher Generation launching today: your first growth lever isn't writing more — it's going Live once, early, to push a notification to every subscriber you acquire in the next 30 days.

**Tool & Stack Updates:**

Cursor shipped v2.5.20 on February 20, v2.5.17 on February 17, and v2.4.37 on February 14. No breaking changes flagged. Cursor also added two separate usage pools — Auto+Composer and API — and boosted limits for Auto and Composer 1.5 across all individual plans, including a limited-time 6× boost. Check your plan page if you're watching costs.

The most recent confirmed Claude Code release is v2.1.50, tagged February 20, 2026. It added support for `startupTimeout` configuration for LSP servers, `WorktreeCreate` and `WorktreeRemove` hook events enabling custom VCS setup and teardown when agent worktrees create or remove worktrees, and fixed memory leaks in `TaskOutput`, `CircularBuffer`, and shell command execution. Nothing that changes your workflow today.

Roo Code's most recent release is v3.47.0 from February 5, 2026. Key changes include renaming the `search_and_replace` tool to `edit` with a unified UI, rendering nested subtasks as a recursive tree in the history view, and adding a `disabledTools` setting to globally disable native tools. No breaking changes for your current workflow, but the `disabledTools` setting is worth knowing when you spec Cockpit v0.3 rules.

**API Economics:**

Nothing new in the API landscape today that affects your stack.

## 📊 PIONEER ADVANTAGE CHECK

| Development | Your Edge | Window | Real or Hype? | Builder Impact? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`obra/superpowers`** — composable skill library for Claude Code / Cursor (spec → plan → subagent execution, TDD-enforced) | Installs in one command into Cursor or Claude Code. Turns your Cockpit philosophy into *automated enforcement* — the agent asks for a spec before writing a single line, refuses to skip planning, and dispatches subagents per task with two-stage review. This is Cockpit v0.3 handed to you on a plate. | 4–6 weeks before this is widely discovered and templated by the masses | **Real.** MIT-licensed, production-quality README, Jesse (obra) is a credible open-source contributor. Not a demo. | **HIGH.** Install today. Your second game project — the first real Cockpit test — has no codebase baggage. `Superpowers` is ideal for greenfield. Run `/plugin install superpowers` in Cursor and start your next game session with it active. Source: [github.com/obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) |
| **Boris Tane's Claude Code workflow** — Research.md → Plan.md → Annotate cycle → Todo list → Implement | The annotation cycle (add inline notes, send Claude back, repeat 1–6x, never implement until you say so) is a battle-tested articulation of what you've been groping toward with The Cockpit. It names the failure mode exactly: *implementations that work in isolation but break the surrounding system.* | Not a time-sensitive window — this is a methodology, not a tool. But reading it today, before your second game, matters. | **Real.** 9 months of daily Claude Code use. No product to sell. High cross-feed endorsement (HN Score 10/10, CrossFeed 3). | **HIGH.** One article, one read, one Cockpit rule to add: *no implementation until research.md exists and you've reviewed it.* This closes the gap between Cockpit v0.1 (manual checklists) and v0.3 (enforced architecture). Source: [boristane.com](https://boristane.com/blog/how-i-use-claude-code/) |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.6 cost parity with Opus** — 79.6% vs 80.8% SWE-bench, at 1/5th the price ($3/$15 vs $15/$75 per M tokens) | You burned ~€60–70 yesterday using Opus for tasks Sonnet handles at near-identical benchmark scores. Your new Cockpit rule (Opus = architecture, Sonnet = implementation) is validated by hard data, not intuition. | Immediate. This is already true and actionable today. | **Real.** VentureBeat and The New Stack both confirmed benchmarks independently. Developer preference data (70% prefer Sonnet 4.6 over Sonnet 4.5) backs it up. | **HIGH.** Applying this rule consistently on the second game project could reduce your per-project AI cost by 60–70% with no measurable output quality loss. Source: [venturebeat.com](https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropics-sonnet-4-6-matches-flagship-ai-performance-at-one-fifth-the-cost) |
| **`earl`** — AI-safe CLI that sits between your agent and external services (secrets in OS keychain, HCL-reviewed templates, egress rules, sandboxed bash) | As your automation stack grows (PRISM, NightCrawler, staffing system, Now Page Bot), your agents increasingly touch external APIs. `earl` prevents the class of mistake where an agent reads a plaintext secret or makes an unreviewed API call. | 2–3 months before this becomes standard practice in non-technical founder stacks | **Real, but premature for your stack today.** Your current projects don't yet have the attack surface `earl` is solving. File for Cockpit v1.0 planning. | **MEDIUM.** Worth understanding now; worth implementing when the staffing system's Cloudflare Worker stack gets its next build cycle.

## 🛠️ TOOLS TO TRY

- **`obra/superpowers`** — A complete agent workflow layer for Claude Code and Cursor. Composable "skills" that auto-trigger: brainstorming before any code, spec extraction, plan writing in bite-sized tasks (2–5 min each), subagent-driven execution with two-stage review, and TDD enforcement throughout. The agent cannot skip steps — skills are mandatory workflows, not suggestions. [github.com/obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)
  - **Try it:** Open Cursor. Run `/plugin-add superpowers`. Start a new session and type "help me plan my next game." Watch the brainstorming skill trigger and refuse to let you write code until a design document exists. 30 minutes to install, test, and decide if it replaces your manual Cockpit checklists.
  - **Relevance:** Directly relevant to **The Cockpit v0.3** and the **second game project**. This is the enforcement layer you described wanting — the AI that won't let you vibe-code even if you try.
  - **Signal:** Tier 3, CrossFeed 1, Score 7.7/10. Discovered via PRISM's curated source (mshibanami.github.io). Low noise, high signal.

- **Boris Tane's Research → Plan → Annotate workflow** — Not a tool, but a method precise enough to be one. The workflow: Claude writes `research.md` (deep read, not skim), you review it, Claude writes `plan.md`, you add inline notes directly in the file ("not optional," "remove this section," "use drizzle:generate, not raw SQL"), Claude updates, repeat 1–6x, then and only then: implement. [boristane.com/blog/how-i-use-claude-code](https://boristane.com/blog/how-i-use-claude-code/)
  - **Try it:** Before your next coding session on any project, open a new Roo Code or Claude Code chat and give this exact prompt: *"Read this folder in depth, understand how it works and all its specificities. When done, write a detailed report of your findings in research.md."* Do not proceed until you've read and annotated the output.
  - **Relevance:** Closes the architecture gap in The Cockpit v0.1. Directly actionable for the **second game project** and for the **Now Page Bot Phase 1 fix**.
  - **Signal:** HN Tier 2, Score 10/10, CrossFeed 3 — highest-scoring article in today's feed.

## 🏗️ BUILD WATCH

**The spec-driven development stack is crystallising.** Three independent signals this week converge on the same architecture: `obra/superpowers` (enforce planning before code), Boris Tane's annotation workflow (review artifacts, not chat), and the Feb 22 Codex article (models are trained *in the presence of* structured harnesses). This is no longer a collection of tips — it is a coherent methodology with tooling. The non-technical founder who internalises this pattern in February 2026 is operating at the same structural level as senior engineers at AI-native companies. The window is real but measured in weeks, not months.

**AI agent security tooling is nascent but directional.** `earl` (AI-safe CLI) and the broader pattern of sandboxed agent execution are early signals that the "agent with shell access" risk is being taken seriously by open-source builders. For solo founders running automation stacks, this trajectory matters: the question is not *if* you'll need reviewed, templated agent calls, but *when* your stack is complex enough to warrant it.

**The "last mile" problem in AI coding is honest and unresolved.** The Claude-as-Electron-app essay (Article 9) is the most intellectually honest thing in today's feed: AI agents handle the first 90% brilliantly but the last 10% — edge cases, real-world messy input, cross-platform support surface — remains human-dependent. For a solo founder, this is not discouraging; it is clarifying. Your job is to architect the 90% correctly and reserve your human attention for the 10% that requires judgement.

## ⏪ ACTION AUDIT

No previous actions to track — this is your first tracked briefing day.

---

## 🎯 TODAY'S PRIORITIES

**1. SHIP. Everything goes live today. No new features.**
julien.care, Chez Julien Simulator, Sweden Odyssey, The Dishwasher Generation — all four launch simultaneously as planned. The only acceptable task before noon is final copy polish on julien.care voice and text. The Cockpit rule applies: no moving forward without review. Do one final read-through of the site copy, then push.

**2. Publish your first Substack post and go Live within 48 hours.**
Substack Live pushes a notification to your entire subscriber list with no algorithm barrier — meaning the 30 people who subscribe on day one all get pinged when you go Live on day three. That's your actual launch amplifier. Write the first post today as planned, and schedule a short Live session for February 25. It doesn't need to be long. It needs to exist.

**3. Don't touch any other project until those four are live.**
Now Page Bot, PRISM v2.0, Sales Data, "All We Got Is Weeks" — all of them wait. The Cockpit's Three Laws exist precisely for today: *no moving forward without iteration, no "done" without review.* Launch day is not the day to open a new conversation about something else.

## 🌍 WORLD LENS

**US-Europe friction is no longer episodic — it is structural.** France's summoning of the US ambassador (Charles Kushner) over the Quentin Deranque affair is the visible tip of a widening fault line. The underlying issues — US sanctions on EU Commissioner Thierry Breton and ICC judge Nicolas Guillou, the Trump administration's repeated interventions in European domestic politics, and Macron's letter to Trump requesting sanction reversals — represent something qualitatively different from prior transatlantic squabbles. Washington is now treating Europe's regulatory apparatus (DSA enforcement, international court participation) as an adversarial chokepoint rather than an allied framework. Barrot told media he had topics beyond Deranque to discuss with Kushner, including US sanctions on Thierry Breton and Nicolas Guillou, describing them as "unjustified and unjustifiable" attacks on EU autonomy.

**What this means for a Brussels founder:** The Belgian economy is deeply embedded in EU institutional and trade architecture. If the US-EU relationship continues to deteriorate — particularly around digital regulation (Breton was the architect of the DSA) — the regulatory environment for software products sold into the US market becomes less predictable. For now, this is background noise for a micro-SaaS builder. It becomes material if you ever distribute software to US customers and face a regulatory divergence between Brussels compliance requirements and US market expectations.

**Trump's flat-rate tariff structure** is paywalled at the FT but the headline alone is analytically useful: a flat-rate tariff (as opposed to product-specific tariffs) is structurally favourable to countries with diversified export baskets — which is why the FT frames it as a "boost for China and Brazil." For Belgium, which exports both high-value manufactured goods and specialty food products, the direction of tariff policy matters more than any single rate. The structural shift toward protectionism raises the cost of imported specialty food inputs — relevant to Chez Julien's supplier chain — more slowly than headlines suggest, but the direction is set.

**Consumer confidence in Belgium:** No direct data in today's feed. However, the broader European retail trend — experiential food markets gaining ground, premium independent retailers holding their own against discounters — suggests the specialty food segment is structurally resilient. Brussels is set to get what is being called Belgium's largest food market, led by the founders of the Wolf and Fox food markets, featuring 14 food stalls with an emphasis on Middle Eastern and Asian cuisines. This is competition, but it is also validation: experiential food retail in Brussels is expanding, not contracting.

## 🇪🇺 EUROPE TECH

**EU battery regulation arrives in 2027 — quiet infrastructure change.** Starting in 2027, consumers will be able to remove and replace the portable batteries in their electronic products at any time during the product lifecycle, under the EU Batteries Regulation. For a micro-SaaS founder, this is irrelevant to software. It matters only as context for hardware projects — the new leash design, furniture-building interest, and any future physical product work. EU product compliance has long lead times; file it now.

**Europe's trade posture hardening.** The FT's "weaponise its chokepoints" headline (paywalled) signals an editorial consensus forming: Europe should use its regulatory leverage — GDPR, DSA, antitrust — as geopolitical tools in response to US pressure. This has direct implications for AI tool regulation: expect EU AI Act enforcement to become more assertive in 2026, not less, as a signal of regulatory sovereignty. For a Brussels-based builder selling software in Europe, this is mostly protective cover; for one selling to US enterprise customers, it is a compliance complexity to watch.

Nothing else material on EU tech in today's feed.

## 📈 TREND TRACKER

**Spec-first AI development** — *Day 2 of explicit coverage; accelerating.*
- Feb 22: Codex article confirmed model-harness co-design. The AI performs better when wrapped in structure.
- Feb 23: Boris Tane's workflow + `obra/superpowers` both independently arrive at the same conclusion with different implementations.
- **Pattern:** This is not a trend — it is a consolidation. The vibe-coding era is over for anyone paying attention. The spec-first methodology is becoming the default discourse in serious AI-assisted development circles.

**Claude Sonnet 4.6 cost parity signal** — *New this week; likely sticky.*
- Feb 23: Independent benchmarks confirm near-identical SWE performance at 1/5th Opus cost.
- **Pattern:** The model cost conversation is shifting from "which model is best" to "which model is sufficient." For solo founders, sufficiency at lowest cost is the correct frame. Expect this to become conventional wisdom within 2–3 weeks.

**AI slop content farms** — *Recurring signal; no new development.*
- The `ai-ublock-blacklist` project (Article 10) is a symptom, not a trend. The problem (AI-generated SEO garbage degrading search quality) is real and growing. For Julien's Substack and julien.care: the counter-positioning is obvious — human voice, lived experience, named author, specific geography. The slop farms cannot replicate any of that. **Your launch timing is correct.**

**US-Europe political friction** — *Escalating; now structural, not episodic.*
- Feb 17: Background noise.
- Feb 22–23: France summons US ambassador; Macron writes directly to Trump; EU regulatory figures sanctioned.
- **Pattern:** Watch for EU AI Act enforcement becoming a political signal, not just a compliance exercise.

**Substack as founder distribution** — *Steady; no new acceleration.*
- Platform metrics stable (50M active subscribers, 5M paid). The "Substack Live" tactic (push notifications to full list, no algorithm) is the one concrete differentiator worth testing post-launch. File for Week 2.

## 🚮 SLOP FILTER

**7 of 13 Tier 2 articles were noise today.**

- **Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 8** (all FT): Five paywalled articles with zero extractable content. FT consistently delivers headlines-only without a subscription. These clog the feed every run.
- **Article 10** (AI uBlock Blacklist): Legitimate tool, zero relevance to Julien's build stack or business. Interesting as cultural signal (AI slop is real), covered briefly in Trend Tracker and nothing more.
- **Article 11** (EU Battery Regulation, 2023 article): This is a 2023 document that surfaced with a 2026 HN submission timestamp. Not news. The 2027 deadline is noted once above and filed. Dead weight in the feed.

**6 of 13 articles delivered real signal:** Articles 1, 2, 9, 12, 13 (tools/methodology), and Article 7 (France/US geopolitics). The HN feed is outperforming the FT feed by a wide margin today.

---

## 🔄 FEED HEALTH REPORT

**KEEP:**
- **Hacker News (hnrss.org)** — Delivering the highest-signal content two briefings running. Articles 1, 9, 10, 13 all came from here. The Boris Tane article (Score 10/10) is the best piece in the last three briefings.
- **Curated GitHub sources (mshibanami.github.io)** — `obra/superpowers` arrived through this channel. Small feed, high hit rate.
- **The Guardian** — France/US diplomatic story (Article 7) was clean, fully extractable, and geopolitically relevant. Earns its place.

**WATCH:**
- **ft.com** — Five articles today, five paywalls, zero content. The FT's value in PRISM depends entirely on whether the RSS feed delivers article text or just headlines. Today: zero text. If this pattern holds for a third consecutive run, it should be deprioritised or replaced with a free mirror source for the same analytical coverage (e.g., Project Syndicate, VoxEU).

**CONSIDER ADDING:**
- **VentureBeat AI** — Surfaced twice in web intelligence (Sonnet 4.6 benchmark story, Cockpit cost validation) but not in the feed. Clean, technical AI coverage with verifiable claims. Low slop rate.
- **RetailDetail EU** — The Brussels food market story came from web intelligence, not the feed. For Chez Julien's competitive context, this is a directly relevant Belgian retail trade publication.
- **boristane.com / practitioner dev blogs** — The Boris Tane article arrived via HN. A small curated list of practitioners writing about AI-assisted development workflows (no products to sell, long-form, evidence-based) would consistently produce Cockpit-relevant signal.

**CONSIDER REMOVING:**
- **ft.com** — Third consecutive run delivering paywalled-only content. Flag for removal after one more run. Replace with Project Syndicate or VoxEU for equivalent analytical depth on European economics and trade.
