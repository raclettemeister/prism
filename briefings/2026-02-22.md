## 🔴 THE SIGNAL

OpenAI's Gabriel Chua published a definitive breakdown of the Codex architecture today: **Codex = Model + Harness + Surfaces** — where the harness is the collection of instructions and tools, and critically, it's open source. More importantly, he confirmed that Codex models are *trained in the presence of the harness* — tool use, execution loops, and iterative verification aren't bolted-on behaviors, they're baked into how the model learns to operate. This is the clearest articulation yet of why harness-first thinking — exactly what The Cockpit is building toward — is the correct mental model for AI-assisted engineering in 2026.

## 📚 MUST-READ LIST

- **[How I think about Codex](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/22/how-i-think-about-codex/)** by Gabriel Chua (via Simon Willison) — simonwillison.net
  - **Why read it:** You built The Cockpit v0.1 today as a discipline harness. This article is the technical validation that the harness *is* the agent — not a wrapper around it. It will sharpen your vocabulary and your v0.3 Roo Code enforcement design.
  - **Cross-fed by:** simonwillison.net (Tier 1), Query 8 web intelligence (OpenAI harness engineering)
  - **Conversation value:** Decide how to frame The Cockpit's "Three Laws" as harness constraints, not just personal rules. This is the architecture decision behind your architecture decision.

- **[The AI productivity boom is not here (yet)](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2026/02/22/the-ai-productivity-boom-is-not-here-yet)** — The Economist
  - **Why read it:** You're betting your time on AI-assisted micro-software building. The Economist is asking why measurable productivity gains aren't showing up at scale — understanding the counterargument makes you a sharper builder, and sharpens your Substack voice for the Feb 23 launch.
  - **Cross-fed by:** economist.com (Tier 1)
  - **Conversation value:** Form an opinion: are *you* the productivity boom? Or are you also subject to it? Worth one paragraph in Dishwasher Generation.

## 🧱 BUILDER INTELLIGENCE

**Methodology beat:**

The harness-first paradigm crystallized today across multiple independent sources. Codex models are trained in the presence of the harness — tool use, execution loops, compaction, and iterative verification are part of how the model learns to operate, not bolted-on behaviors. This is exactly the theoretical foundation The Cockpit is building on.

OpenAI's published harness engineering methodology pushes all architectural knowledge — decisions, schemas, plans — into the repository itself as versioned artifacts. Knowledge that lives in chat threads or people's heads is effectively invisible to the system. Your SPEC.md and STATUS.md files in every project are already aligned with this. The Cockpit's "no code without architecture" Law #1 is literally the practitioner consensus.

The central principle for 2026 is that agent harness infrastructure must be *lightweight* — every new model release brings a different optimal way to structure agents, and developers must build harnesses that allow them to quickly discard yesterday's "smart" logic. Keep The Cockpit's checklists in markdown. Don't over-engineer the enforcement layer before you've tested it.

Model selection is now a key orchestration lever: rapid, interruptible, context-hungry models suffice for everyday developer workflows, while "Einstein-class" models are reserved for marathon tasks. This is the direct answer to your €60-70 Opus day. The Cockpit needs a rule for this.

**Micro-SaaS Radar:**

The broader shift noted across sources is that implementation speed is no longer the competitive advantage — "implementation is getting cheaper," and the scarce resource is now *judgment*: knowing what's worth building and having the taste and customer understanding to steer fast AI-driven iterations. This is the moat for a non-technical CEO who builds. Your life experience (Chez Julien, Lucia, Poncho, weeks workshop) is the judgment layer. Protect it.

**Ratz**, a new food market billing itself as the largest in Belgium, is opening in the Brussels municipality of Ixelles, spanning three floors and 3,000 square meters. Monitor for foot traffic effects on Chez Julien — new specialty food destinations in Brussels reshape local consumer patterns.

**Tool & Stack Updates:**

**Cursor 2.5** launched on February 17, 2026, introducing the **Cursor Marketplace** — an official plugin distribution platform allowing developers to install prebuilt plugins (bundles of MCP servers, skills, subagents, hooks, and rules) accessible at `cursor.com/marketplace` or via `/add-plugin`. Ten verified launch partners were confirmed: Figma, Linear, Stripe, AWS, **Cloudflare**, Vercel, Databricks, Snowflake, Amplitude, and Hex. Cloudflare is a launch partner — relevant given your Cloudflare Workers staffing infra.

Cursor also introduced **Subagents**, enabling parallel task execution — a shift from the previous serial agent model. A cross-platform agent sandbox rolling out on macOS delivers 40% fewer approval blocks. This matters for your Mac Mini workflow and will reduce interruption fatigue on longer Cockpit sessions.

**Roo Code:** The most recent release is **version 3.47.0** (February 5, 2026), which renamed `search_and_replace` to `edit` with a unified edit-family UI, rendered nested subtasks as a recursive tree in history view, and added a `disabledTools` setting to globally disable native tools. No breaking changes to your current setup.

**API Economics:**

Claude Sonnet 4.6 was released on February 17, 2026, achieving **79.6% on SWE-bench** — nearly identical to Opus 4.6's 80.8% — at **$3/$15 per million tokens**, compared to Opus 4.6's $5/$25. For agentic coding workflows, tasks that previously required Opus (~$3.00/session) now run on Sonnet (~$0.60/session) — an ~80% cost reduction with minimal quality loss. The €60-70 day becomes a €12-14 day with the same output quality on implementation tasks. This is the single most actionable cost signal for The Cockpit.

## 📊 PIONEER ADVANTAGE CHECK

| Development | Your Edge | Window | Real or Hype? | Builder Impact? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Separation of planning/execution (Boris Tane method)** — research.md → plan.md → annotation cycle → todo list → implement | You built v0.1 of The Cockpit today with this exact logic. The published workflow validates your architecture before you've shipped a single v0.3 feature. Your SPEC.md system *is* this, in embryonic form. | 2–4 months before this becomes the default mental model for non-technical founders | **Real** — HN cross-feed 3, 10/10 score, published Feb 10, validated by 9 months of production use | **HIGH.** The annotation cycle (inline notes → "don't implement yet" guard) is a direct, copy-paste upgrade to The Cockpit's PRE-FLIGHT phase. Actionable today. |
| **`obra/superpowers`** — composable skill system for Claude Code/Cursor; enforces spec → plan → subagent → TDD automatically | It installs as a plugin in Cursor. Your Second Game project is the first real Cockpit test — this framework *is* The Cockpit, externalized and enforced | 1–3 months before this pattern gets absorbed into mainstream Cursor defaults | **Real** — open source, MIT, verified installable via `/plugin-add superpowers` in Cursor | **HIGH.** Direct Cursor install. Enforces the Three Laws automatically without manual checklist discipline. Worth exploring before v0.3 Cockpit design is locked. |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.6 vs Opus 4.6** — 79.6% vs 80.8% SWE-bench, ~80% cost reduction | You burned €60–70 on Opus 4.6 yesterday. Sonnet 4.6 does implementation tasks at essentially identical benchmark performance for one-fifth the price | Permanent structural shift — not a window, a new baseline | **Real** — VentureBeat, The New Stack, YBuild, all Feb 2026. Numbers verified. | **HIGH.** Immediate. The Cockpit cost discipline rule is now evidence-based: Opus for architecture, Sonnet for implementation. Could reduce daily spend to €12–15 on heavy sessions. |
| **Cursor Marketplace + Subagents (v2.5, Feb 17)** — parallel task execution, Figma/Cloudflare/Vercel launch partners | Your Cloudflare Worker infra (staffing system) is a verified launch partner ecosystem. Subagents unlock parallel implementation — relevant for Now Page Bot's 7-fix backlog | 2–3 months before non-technical founders systematically exploit this | **Real** — Cursor 2.5 confirmed Feb 17. Marketplace live at cursor.com/marketplace | **MEDIUM.** Parallel subagents are powerful but require architectural clarity first. Don't touch until Cockpit v0.3 is stable. Monitor for now. |
| **ByePhone** — AI agent that makes phone calls on your behalf | Adjacent to Chez Julien operations — supplier calls, reservation disputes, admin overhead that Henry could offload | 3–6 months before Belgian SME operators discover this category | **Real but early** — live product, Show HN Feb 22 | **LOW-MEDIUM.** Not a builder tool. Operational value for the shop. Worth bookmarking for Operation Autonomy phase when Henry is managing independently. |

## 🛠️ TOOLS TO TRY

- **`obra/superpowers`** — A complete AI coding workflow as composable "skills" installed directly into Cursor or Claude Code. Enforces: brainstorm → spec → plan → subagent execution → TDD → code review, automatically. The agent can't skip steps.
  - Install: In Cursor Agent chat, type `/plugin-add superpowers` — then start a new session and ask it to "help me plan a feature" to verify it triggers
  - Try it: Open the Second Game project folder. Ask Cursor (with Superpowers active) to brainstorm the game concept. Watch how it refuses to write code until you've signed off on a written spec. Compare to your current Cockpit checklist.
  - Relevance: **The Cockpit v0.3** — this is an external, already-built version of what you're trying to build manually. Use it as primary research before designing your Roo Code enforcement layer
  - Signal: Surfaced via `mshibanami.github.io` feed, Tier 3, score 7.7/10. Independent source, not HN-amplified — but the architecture is validated by the Boris Tane article (Tier 2, score 10/10, HN cross-feed 3) which describes the same planning/execution separation philosophy

- **`boristane.com` — "How I use Claude Code"** — Not a tool but a workflow document worth treating as one. The annotation cycle (open plan.md in editor → add inline notes → send Claude back → "don't implement yet") is a direct protocol upgrade.
  - Try it: Read once. Then on your next Now Page Bot Phase 1 session (format.js), run the full Boris Tane loop: research.md first, then plan.md, then annotate before a single line of code touches format.js
  - Relevance: **Now Page Bot** (7 formatting issues, Phase 1 ready) and **Second Game** (first real Cockpit test)
  - Signal: HN cross-feed 3, score 10/10 — highest-scored article in today's set

## 🏗️ BUILD WATCH

**The harness wars are consolidating around two poles.** This week's evidence points to a fork in the market: heavyweight orchestration frameworks (OpenAI Codex harness, ACP protocol by Zed/JetBrains) versus lightweight skill-file systems (`obra/superpowers`, Claude Pilot from Feb 17 briefing). The lightweight pole is winning on adoption speed. `superpowers` installs in one command; the Codex harness requires reading a 4,000-word engineering post. For solo non-technical founders, the lightweight pole is the only viable one in the near term.

**"Why is Claude an Electron app?"** is a more important question than it looks. The `dbreunig.com` piece surfaces a structural insight: coding agents are excellent at the first 90% of development but the last 10% — edge cases, real-world messiness, ongoing support — remains hard and human-dependent. For a founder building micro-software: this is not a reason to stop. It's a reason to scope micro. Build things where the last 10% is small, not large. Chez Julien BI, Now Page Bot, and The Cockpit are all well-scoped. The Second Game is the first project where scope discipline will matter.

**Local/edge AI inference is becoming a genuine product category.** `zclaw` (AI personal assistant in 888KB on an ESP32) and the Juno Labs piece ("every company building your AI assistant is now an ad company") point to the same structural trend: privacy-motivated users will pay for local inference hardware. This is not directly actionable for Julien today, but it's a trajectory worth tracking. The business model question — sell hardware + software, not data — is a template that applies to micro-SaaS thinking more broadly.

## 🎯 TODAY'S PRIORITIES

**1. Ship the Feb 23 launch tonight.**
julien.care text polish is the last open item. Everything else is done. Don't let The Cockpit energy pull you into new architecture work before the launch is out the door. Finish the thing that's 95% done first.

**2. Add one rule to The Cockpit before you sleep: the model selection gate.**
Sonnet for implementation. Opus only for architecture decisions and complex reasoning. The cost differential is ~80% — this single rule prevents the next €60-70 day. Write it as Law #4 or a PRE-FLIGHT checklist step. One sentence. Ship it to SPEC.md tonight.

**3. Read the Codex harness article before your next coding session.**
Codex = Model + Harness + Surfaces is the mental model that makes The Cockpit's v0.3 AI enforcement layer (Roo Code/Cursor rules) designable. Don't start the Second Game's SPEC until you've absorbed this framing. It's a 5-minute read with high architectural leverage.

## 🌍 WORLD LENS

**The France-US diplomatic rupture over Deranque signals a structural shift in transatlantic political norms.** The death of a French far-right activist in Lyon has become the proxy for a deeper confrontation: the US State Department's Bureau of Counter-Terrorism publicly labeling a French domestic incident as evidence of "violent radical leftism" — and France summoning the US ambassador in response — marks an escalation beyond trade or tech regulation disputes. The significance for a Brussels-based founder is not the incident itself but what it reveals about the operating environment: European political institutions are being pressured from Washington in ways that were previously unimaginable, and the EU is increasingly forced to decide whether to absorb or resist.

**For Chez Julien specifically:** the geopolitical pressure is arriving through trade channels, not diplomatic ones. The FT's paywalled coverage of Trump's flat-rate tariff regime (confirmed headline visible) suggests the US is moving away from sector-specific tariffs toward blanket instruments. For a specialty food shop in Brussels, the transmission mechanism is indirect but real: imported specialty products (American goods, goods routed through tariff-affected supply chains) may face price volatility. Belgian food retailers are already navigating stricter advertising rules from January 2026 (age limit for marketing raised from 13 to 16). The Ratz food market opening in Ixelles — 3,000 square meters, billed as Belgium's largest food market — adds competitive pressure to the specialty food retail space in Brussels specifically.

**The EU's structural response to US pressure is being debated in real time.** Two FT headlines — "Europe needs to learn the art of the trade deal" and "It is time for Europe to weaponise its chokepoints" — point to a growing European consensus that passive rule-following is insufficient. This matters to a Brussels founder because Brussels *is* the EU's regulatory capital. Any shift in EU trade posture, digital regulation, or sovereign technology policy will be felt locally and quickly. The EU AI Act's phased implementation continues in this context — compliance obligations for AI systems are not yet a concern for micro-software at Julien's scale, but the direction of travel is toward more, not less, EU oversight of AI-embedded products.

**Consumer confidence in Belgium:** no direct data in today's feed. The competitive pressure from Ratz and the tariff environment suggests this is a moment to watch Chez Julien's margins carefully — the BI data project started Feb 22 is well-timed.

## 🇪🇺 EUROPE TECH

**EU battery regulation is moving toward the 2027 replaceable-battery mandate** — confirmed by an EU Commission article surfacing in today's feed (originally 2023 regulation, HN-amplified Feb 22). From 2027, consumers must be able to remove and replace portable batteries in electronic devices at any time during the product lifecycle. This has zero immediate impact on Julien's software work, but it does intersect with the Poncho leash / physical product interest and any hardware-adjacent projects. If AI-assisted physical design becomes a real workstream, understanding EU product regulation is table stakes.

**LinkedIn identity verification and GDPR exposure** — the `thelocalstack.eu` article (1,354 HN points, 462 comments) documents the data handed over during LinkedIn's identity verification flow. For a Brussels founder building public products (julien.care launches today), this is a reminder that EU-based users have GDPR rights that differ meaningfully from US-default product assumptions. As julien.care goes public, data handling transparency is not optional — even at micro-scale, Belgian users have recourse under GDPR that US users don't.

**The diving instructor vulnerability disclosure case** (GDPR angle) is worth noting structurally: a security researcher in Europe followed responsible disclosure protocols, notified CSIRT Malta as required by the EU's NCVDP policy, and received legal threats in return. The lesson for a founder building data-handling products in Belgium: document your security practices, have a disclosure policy, and understand that GDPR creates both obligations and protections.

## 📈 TREND TRACKER

**Planning/execution separation — Day 1 of explicit tracking.** Boris Tane's article (Feb 10, surfaced Feb 22 with HN cross-feed 3) articulates the same principle Julien independently arrived at building The Cockpit. The convergence is signal, not coincidence. This principle — never let AI write code until a written plan is reviewed and approved — is becoming the dominant mental model for serious AI-assisted developers. Expect it to be absorbed into mainstream Cursor/Claude Code defaults within 2–3 months.

**AI cost discipline — accelerating.** Three consecutive briefings have touched this theme: Feb 17 (Claude Pilot, cost-aware hook systems), Feb 19 (Anthropic $30B raise, pricing stability), Feb 22 (Sonnet 4.6 benchmarks). The market is consolidating around a two-tier model selection strategy: reasoning-class models for architecture, implementation-class models for execution. This is now a stable principle, not a temporary optimization.

**Harness vocabulary — now canonical.** Feb 22's THE SIGNAL introduced "harness" as the correct word for what Julien is building. Today's `obra/superpowers` and Boris Tane articles both use the same framework — research → plan → implement — without using the word "harness" but describing the same architecture. The vocabulary and the practice are converging from different directions. The Cockpit v0.3 AI enforcement layer should be designed using this vocabulary explicitly.

**AI assistant advertising — new and structurally important.** ChatGPT ads went live Feb 9 (confirmed in Juno Labs article). This is the first week this has appeared in Julien's feed. It will not be the last. The privacy-vs-convenience tension in AI assistants is entering a new phase. No immediate action required, but worth tracking as it affects which AI tools are trustworthy for business-sensitive conversations.

**Disappeared this week:** Letta AI agents (built Feb 15, not mentioned since). PRISM v2.0 (spec complete, parked). These are correctly parked — no new signal to justify revisiting.

## 🚮 SLOP FILTER

**11 of 18 Tier 2 articles were noise today.**

- **Articles 4–8 (all FT):** Five paywalled Financial Times articles with zero content accessible. Headlines only. Filtered. The FT paywall blocks everything — these slots are wasted feed capacity.
- **Article 2 (Karpathy tweet):** Twitter/X JavaScript wall — no content retrievable. The tweet itself (Karpathy on "claws" as a new LLM agent layer) may have been genuinely interesting, but the source returned an empty page. Filtered.
- **Article 10 (France/Deranque, The Guardian):** Not noise — moved to WORLD LENS. The geopolitical signal is real.
- **Article 12 (LinkedIn identity verification):** Borderline. 1,354 HN points suggests real signal; moved to EUROPE TECH for GDPR relevance.
- **Article 13 (AI uBlock blacklist):** Pure personal project, no founder relevance. Filtered.
- **Article 14 (diving instructor vulnerability):** GDPR angle salvaged one paragraph for EUROPE TECH. The security story itself is not actionable.
- **Article 15 (EU battery mandate, 2023 article):** Three-year-old regulation resurfacing on HN. Minor future relevance for physical products noted and filed. Not today's news.
- **Article 17 (virtual Zen garden):** Charming. Irrelevant. Filtered.

**Kept and used:** Articles 1, 3, 9, 11, 16, 18 — plus all web intelligence queries.

## 🔄 FEED HEALTH REPORT

- **KEEP:**
  - `news.ycombinator.com` — Consistently the highest-signal feed. Articles 1, 3, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 all originated here. Even the noise is findable and filterable. Cross-feed endorsements (Boris Tane at 3x) are a reliable quality signal.
  - `mshibanami.github.io` — Surfaced `obra/superpowers` (score 7.7/10) independently of HN. Small feed, high hit rate on Cockpit-relevant material. Keep and watch.
  - `simonwillison.net` — Yesterday's THE SIGNAL source. Not in today's article set but produced the most actionable content in the Feb 22 briefing. Consistently high quality.

- **WATCH:**
  - `ft.com` — Five paywalled articles with zero readable content in today's set. The FT feed is generating headline slots with no substance. This is the third consecutive briefing where FT content has been partially or fully inaccessible. If FT does not have a feed configuration that bypasses the paywall, these slots are dead weight.
  - `theguardian.com` — One article today (Deranque/France). Content was accessible and relevant. Quality is there when it appears, but volume is low.

- **CONSIDER ADDING:**
  - `boristane.com` or similar practitioner blogs — Today's highest-scored article came from a personal blog, not a publication. The signal density in "how I actually use AI coding tools" practitioner writing is high and not currently covered by any dedicated feed. Consider adding Simon Willison's links feed or a curated list of AI practitioner bloggers.
  - Belgian/EU economic news source — Nothing in today's feed covered the Ratz food market opening or Belgian consumer confidence directly. RetailDetail EU (source cited in web intelligence) appears to cover Belgian retail specifically. Worth adding.
  - EU AI Act / EU regulatory tracker — The GDPR angle appeared twice today (LinkedIn, diving instructor) but from HN, not a dedicated EU regulatory feed. A source like `euractiv.com` or `iapp.org` would surface EU compliance developments earlier.

- **CONSIDER REMOVING:**
  - `ft.com` — If the current feed configuration cannot access full articles, the five paywalled slots today represent ~28% of the Tier 2 article set with 0% content yield. Either resolve the paywall access or remove the feed and reallocate those slots to sources that deliver readable content.

## 💬 FEEDBACK RESPONSE

No feedback received. React to today's articles at https://prism-portal.pages.dev/briefings/2026-02-22.html

*One proactive note: today is Feb 23 — launch day. The briefing is calibrated for the morning before the launch goes public. If the launch creates feedback, customer reactions, or unexpected technical issues, surface them in tonight's log and PRISM will treat them as primary signal in tomorrow's briefing. The Cockpit Three Laws apply to the post-launch iteration cycle just as much as to pre-launch builds.*
