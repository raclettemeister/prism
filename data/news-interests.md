## PRIMARY MISSION: AI Micro-Software Builder

I am a non-technical CEO (retail background, Brussels, Belgium) transitioning to building
micro-SaaS businesses using AI-assisted engineering. I do not write traditional code —
I use Claude, Cursor, Lovable, Bolt.new, and similar tools to build production software.

**Score HIGHEST** any content about:
- Spec-driven AI development: PRDs, prompt architecture, context management, SPEC.md patterns
- The "70% Problem" — where AI-generated code fails in production, quality guardrails, edge cases
- Solo founder AI workflows: Cursor, Windsurf, Lovable, Bolt.new, v0, Claude Code, Replit
- Micro-SaaS business models, niche product ideas, bootstrapped SaaS case studies
- API economics: Supabase, Stripe, Resend, Cloudflare Workers as building blocks
- Compounding engineering — reusable scripts, agents, system prompts, deployment frameworks
- Non-technical CEO building with AI — the Every / Dan Shipper / Brian Casel pattern
- AI-assisted engineering methodology: parallel agents, vertical slices, definition of done
- Vibe coding insights: what works at scale, what collapses, how to bridge to production quality
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) developments, agentic workflow patterns

**Score LOWER** (not currently my focus):
- ML model architecture, fine-tuning, training infrastructure
- VC fundraising, startup pitching, term sheets
- Enterprise SaaS sales, B2B marketing at scale
- Mobile app development (iOS/Android native)
- Cryptocurrency, blockchain, web3 anything
- Social media growth hacks, follower farming
- US-centric retail/consumer startup advice (I'm in Brussels, different ecosystem)

## ACTIVE PROJECTS (changes frequently — see life-context.md for current state)

- **PRISM** — this system. I care about improvements to AI pipelines, RSS aggregation, agentic briefing systems.
- **Micro-SaaS products** — actively looking for niche ideas to build with AI tools.
- **The Dishwasher Generation** (Substack) — newsletter on AI, work, and the European founder experience.
- **julien.care** — personal blog (friend-style, intimate, analog-feeling tone).
- **Chez Julien** — specialty food shop in Brussels (~€500K annual sales). Running toward autonomy. Not selling.

## AI & TECHNOLOGY INTERESTS

### AI Tools I Use Daily
Very high interest in updates, tutorials, workflow tips for:
- Claude (Anthropic) — especially Claude Code, API updates, context window changes
- Cursor — IDE workflow, new features, keyboard shortcuts, agent mode
- Windsurf — comparisons with Cursor, unique features
- Lovable / Bolt.new / v0 — UI generation, scaffolding, recent updates
- GitHub Copilot — enterprise patterns, limitations vs Claude
- Replit — deployments, agent features

### AI Methodology (very high interest)
- Prompt engineering techniques for non-technical builders
- Spec-driven development: writing PRDs and SPEC.md before coding
- Managing AI context windows efficiently
- Test-driven AI development, automated quality gates
- Agent orchestration, parallel execution patterns
- When to use AI vs when to write manually
- Anti-patterns: "vibe coding" failures, when to stop trusting AI output

### AI Research & Labs
- Anthropic releases (high priority — my entire stack depends on this)
- OpenAI updates (medium — alternative tools)
- Google AI / Gemini (medium — aware but not primary)
- Open-source models: when they reach practical quality for builders

## BUSINESS & FOUNDER INTERESTS

### Micro-SaaS & Indie Founding (very high interest)
- Solo founder success stories: how did they find the idea, build it, price it?
- Niche market validation: signs of underserved pain points
- Pricing strategies for micro-SaaS ($29-$99/month range)
- Churn patterns, retention tactics for small B2B tools
- bootstrapped → $10K MRR journeys
- "Build in public" accounts with concrete numbers
- Acquisition opportunities: micro-SaaS worth buying vs building

### Newsletter & Creator Economy (high interest)
- Substack growth tactics, Notes strategy, monetization milestones
- European newsletter audience building (different from US patterns)
- Creator-founder crossover: turning writing into software products
- Distribution strategies that don't require gaming algorithms

### European Founder Context (high interest)
- EU AI Act implications for indie builders
- Belgian tech ecosystem, Brussels events, EU grants for founders
- European SaaS pricing vs US markets
- GDPR compliance simplified for micro-SaaS
- Hiring in Belgium, labor law for small shops

## GEOPOLITICS & WORLD AFFAIRS

I follow the world closely but through a specific lens:
**"How does this affect a Brussels-based founder building with AI?"**

### What I care about:
- European politics: EU regulation, digital markets, AI governance
- Belgian economy: consumer spending, labor market, import costs (affects Chez Julien)
- ECB monetary policy: interest rates affect my 18-year building mortgage
- Transatlantic relations: US-EU tech policy, AI regulation divergence
- Global supply chains: affects import costs for specialty food
- Big structural trends: de-globalization, energy transition, demographic shifts

### Preferred analytical style:
- The Economist editorial lens: structural analysis, not breaking news panic
- "What does this mean in 5 years?" not "What happened today?"
- Connect global events to Belgian/European business reality
- Adam Tooze, Noah Smith, The Economist > CNN, BBC breaking news

### Skip or score lower:
- Individual political personalities (Macron, Scholz daily drama)
- US domestic politics unless it directly affects European tech policy
- Middle East/Africa/Asia unless affecting European supply chains or AI infrastructure
- Sports, celebrity, entertainment

## TECHNOLOGY BEYOND AI

- Cloudflare: Workers, Pages, KV, D1, R2 — I build on this infrastructure
- Supabase: auth, database, edge functions — my go-to backend
- GitHub Actions: CI/CD, automation workflows
- Vercel / Next.js: deployments, AI SDK
- RSS, data pipelines, automation scripts — PRISM itself is this domain

---

## FORMAT PREFERENCES

- Direct, no fluff. Get to the point in the first sentence.
- Concrete examples beat abstract frameworks
- Numbers matter: "$10K MRR", "2,000 hours", "70% problem" > vague claims
- European perspective appreciated, US-centric advice often doesn't transfer
- Anti-hype: if something sounds too good, I want the skeptical take
- Builder lens: "what can I build with this?" not "what does this mean for enterprises?"
