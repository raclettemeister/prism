## Query 1: Cursor Cloud Agents update February 27 2026

Here is a concise factual summary of the most relevant findings:

---

**Cursor Cloud Agents — "Computer Use" Update (February 24, 2026)**

On **February 24, 2026**, Cursor launched **Cloud Agents with Computer Use** — each agent runs in its own isolated VM with a full development environment, and can now use the software it creates to test changes and demo its work. Cloud agents are accessible from anywhere — including the web, mobile, desktop app, Slack, and GitHub — and onboard themselves onto your codebase, producing merge-ready PRs with artifacts (videos, screenshots, and logs) to demo their changes.

The $29.3 billion AI coding startup's agents can build software, run it, and self-validate — each agent runs in its own isolated VM, removing the need to compete for local resources on a developer's laptop. Notably, 30% of Cursor's own merged pull requests are now created autonomously by cloud agents, a figure cited as evidence of real-world production viability.

## Query 5: micro-SaaS solo founder build methodology published February 2026

Based on my research, here is a concise, factual summary of the most relevant recent findings on **micro-SaaS solo founder build methodology published in February 2026**:

---

The most directly relevant piece published in **February 2026** is by a developer writing under the name NAJEEB in the *Write A Catalyst* publication on Medium. Titled *"From 0 to $2,500: My 6-Step Framework for Building Micro SaaS as a Solo Founder,"* it was published in February 2026 and draws on the author's 10+ years in software development and experience launching three Micro SaaS products that "started generating profits almost instantly on autopilot." The framework's core premise is that "building and exiting a Micro SaaS is a completely different story" from traditional IT companies — one that a solo founder can actually win — and it positions itself explicitly as a practical roadmap, not theory, used to go "from zero to thousands in monthly revenue." A key philosophical pillar of the methodology is to avoid the trap of seeking a unique idea: "The first mistake most founders make is wasting months looking for a unique idea. You must stop this immediately. Just start."

A companion piece by the same author, also from **February 2026**, is titled *"5 Profitable Micro SaaS Ideas You Can Build in 2026,"* which identifies five specific Micro SaaS opportunities with the potential to hit **$15,000 MRR within one year**, emphasizing that "the secret is not to invent a new market but to find expensive problems that businesses are already desperate to solve."

**Source URLs:**

> ⚠️ **Important caveat:** The 6-step framework article is behind Medium's paywall for non-members, so the specific names of all six steps were not fully retrievable via search. I was able to confirm the article's existence, publication date (February 2026), and its top-level methodology — but I cannot verify every granular step without direct access. I recommend visiting the URLs above for the complete, authoritative detail.

## Query 6: Belgium specialty food retail acquisition chains centralized kitchen buyers 2026

Here is a concise, sourced summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

**Belgium Specialty Food Retail, Acquisitions & Centralized Kitchen Buyers — 2026**

The most significant recent development is Delhaize Belgium's major chain consolidation. On **February 2, 2026**, Ahold Delhaize announced that Delhaize Belgium completed the acquisition of **Delfood NV**, comprising **303 stores** in Belgium (all *Louis Delhaize* stores and those supplied through Delfood), plus logistics services and the Belgian headquarters — expanding Delhaize's network to a total of **1,109 stores** across Belgium and Luxembourg. The Belgian Competition Authority (BCA) granted conditional approval, clearing the deal by end of January 2026.

On the **centralized kitchen / specialty food** side, **BON** (Juice & Lunch Bar, backed by Colruyt Group with a 45.65% stake acquired in September 2024) is expanding its **central kitchen in Sint-Lambrechts-Woluwe to 1,500 m²**, supplying its own stores as well as all *Okay City* stores and fifty *Okay* stores of Colruyt Group, plus B2B customers — with three new BON locations planned for 2026.

For specialty food buyers and exporters, trade shows like **Tavola** are highlighted as particularly effective for reaching Belgian buyers of premium, artisanal, and differentiated specialty food products, with Belgian buyers noted for moving fast post-show on pricing, specs, and samples.

## Query 7: AI assisted 3D asset generation game dev tools solo developer February 2026

Here is a concise summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

**AI-Assisted 3D Asset Generation for Solo Game Developers — Early 2026**

The landscape of 3D content creation is undergoing a major shift driven by generative AI — tools like **Tencent's Hunyuan3D** (open-source, supports text-to-3D and image-to-3D, available for local deployment) and **Sloyd** (procedural + AI, optimized for game-ready hard-surface assets like weapons and furniture) are standout options in February 2026.

Platforms such as **3DAIStudio** highlight a practical solo-dev pipeline: use **Tripo** models for characters (clean quad topology, auto-rigging), **Meshy** for props/environment objects, and **Rodin** for hero assets — all under one subscription covering the entire asset pipeline, with generation times of 30–60 seconds per asset.

A documented two-week solo game-demo sprint using **Tripo 2.5** + Unreal Engine found that feeding Midjourney concept art into Tripo auto-retopologizes and converts 2D art into a textured 3D mesh in minutes; combined with Character Creator's **AccuRIG** and **iClone 8** for animation, a process normally taking weeks was completed in days.

**Ludo.ai** launched its API and Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration on **January 29, 2026**, enabling automated game asset workflows; a February 24, 2026 case study showed indie studio FireBrick Games used it to generate and animate an entire enemy cast for a roguelite deckbuilder, with each sprite animation taking just 2–3 minutes.

## Query 8: Substack API publish script Python breaking change 2026

Based on my research, here is a concise, factual summary of the most relevant findings:

---

**Summary:**

On **March 2, 2025**, Nick Hagar announced the **1.0 release** of his `substack-api` Python package, describing it as "a significant overhaul from the previous 0.1 version, transforming it from a collection of functions into a full-fledged, object-oriented library." The latest release on PyPI is dated **November 3, 2025**, and requires **Python ≥ 3.12**.

The most significant real-world **breaking change** affecting all Substack API publish scripts is an **authentication shift**: Substack's default access method is now via email address with a **"magic link"** sent to the user's inbox — removing the password entirely. Passwords are still possible for users who signed up before 2023, but in 2026, users must actively choose to create one. This means older Python scripts that passed `email=` and `password=` credentials directly to `Api()` may silently fail for newer accounts, and the recommended workaround is now **cookie-based authentication** (`cookies_path` or `cookies_string`). Both the GitHub repo and PyPI package for `substack_api` explicitly warn that "APIs may change without notice, potentially breaking functionality."
