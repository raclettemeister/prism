## Query 1: Cursor IDE update changelog February 23 2026

Based on my research, I can now provide a well-sourced summary. The search results confirm that February 23, 2026 falls within the **Cursor 2.5** release cycle. The most recent logged builds were **2.5.20 (February 20)** and **2.5.17 (February 17)** — there is no separately tagged "February 23" release publicly listed at the time of the search results (which are ~3 days old, consistent with ~Feb 26). Here is the summary:

---

### Cursor IDE — February 2026 Changelog Summary

Around **February 23, 2026**, Cursor was actively shipping updates in the **version 2.5.x** series. The most recent logged builds tracked publicly are **v2.5.20 (February 20)** and **v2.5.17 (February 17)**, available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The headline release for this period was the **Cursor 2.5 Marketplace & Plugin System**, launched February 17. Released February 17, 2026, the update adds an official marketplace where developers can install plugins connecting Figma designs, Stripe payments, AWS infrastructure, and production analytics without switching tools. Cursor 2.5 also adds granular network and filesystem access controls to the sandbox environment.

On the agent capabilities front, the release introduces plugins for extending Cursor, improvements to core agent capabilities like subagents, and fine-grained network controls for sandboxed commands — plugins package skills, subagents, MCP servers, hooks, and rules into a single install. Subagents now run **asynchronously**, allowing the parent agent to continue working while subagents execute in the background, and subagents can spawn their own subagents, creating a tree of coordinated parallel work.

On usage limits, Composer 1.5 has 3× the usage limit of Composer 1, and for a limited time through February 16, that limit was boosted to 6×, with two separate usage pools: Auto + Composer (included) and API (charged separately), and a new in-editor page to monitor both.

> ⚠️ **Note:** No release was specifically tagged "February 23, 2026" in any tracked changelog. The closest surrounding versions are **2.5.20 (Feb 20)** and potentially a patch build shortly after. If you need the exact patch notes for a build released *on* Feb 23, checking the official Cursor changelog at **cursor.com/changelog** directly would give the most precise answer.

## Query 2: Roo Code AI coding cost optimization model tiers February 2026

Based on the search results, here is a concise, factual summary:

---

**Roo Code: Cost Optimization & Model Tiers (Early 2026)**

Roo Code started as a Cline fork and added specialized AI personalities — instead of relying on a single AI to do everything, users switch between different modes (e.g., Architect, Developer, Tester), each with its own distinct behavior and prompting. This directly enables cost optimization: the model-agnostic approach lets developers route cheap tasks to cheap models and expensive tasks to powerful ones — no vendor lock-in, with the ability to switch models per task, per mode, or per mood.

On pricing tiers, Roo Code's Team plan is **$99/month flat for unlimited team members**, which reviewers note is competitive given there is no per-seat pricing. Cloud tasks (background tasks run via Roo Cloud) are charged at **$5/hour** on Pro and Team plans, which can add up for long-running jobs; for most users, the free tier combined with your own API keys is considered the optimal setup.

Roo Code uses its own "Roo SPARC Coding Evaluation & Benchmark System" to assess model efficiency, security, and methodology, testing frontier models against hundreds of exercises across five programming languages — giving users a framework for selecting cost-effective models for each tier of task.

## Query 4: micro-SaaS founder public launch post-launch growth tactics February 2026

Here is a concise, sourced summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

**Micro-SaaS Post-Launch Growth Tactics — February 2026**

On **February 10, 2026**, Founderpath (by Nathan Latka) published a comprehensive SaaS growth playbook compiling **63 tactics across 11 categories**, drawn from SaaS CEOs who built $5M–$100M+ businesses. The playbooks cover organic traffic (SEO, programmatic SEO, AI search optimization), outbound sales (LinkedIn outreach, account-based marketing), and viral loops, with real templates and frameworks.

A late-2025/early-2026 Indie Hackers post on content trends highlights that micro-SaaS founders are shifting away from relying solely on social platforms like Twitter or LinkedIn — due to algorithm volatility — and investing heavily in **owned media**: email newsletters (which see 4× higher engagement than social posts), private communities (Discord, Slack, Circle), and personal blogs.

The organic growth tactics most commonly cited by bootstrapped SaaS teams include **founder-led content** (users trust founders over faceless brands), mini-collaborations with small creators for backlinks and shared audiences, and treating communities (Reddit threads, Slack groups) as research labs to test post ideas before turning them into long-form content.

A key theme across recent posts is that sustainable MRR growth comes from "validating before building, obsessing over retention, and fighting the urge to overbuild" — with doubling down on a niche as the consistent differentiator.

## Query 5: Claude Code Sonnet Opus cost optimization agentic workflow February 2026

Here is a concise, evidence-based summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

**Claude Code Cost Optimization with Sonnet vs. Opus (February 2026)**

Claude Sonnet 4.6, released **February 17, 2026**, holds steady at **$3/$15 per million input/output tokens** — exactly one-fifth the cost of Opus-class models, which are priced at **$15/$75 per million tokens**. It is now the default model on claude.ai and Claude Cowork, with a 1M token context window (beta).

On agentic financial analysis benchmarks, Sonnet 4.6 scored **63.3%**, actually *beating* Opus 4.6's 60.1% — meaning the cheaper model now matches or outperforms flagship Opus in many enterprise-critical categories.

A practical agentic workflow cost optimization published **February 19, 2026** showed that routing sub-agents in Claude Code to Sonnet 4.6 via a single line of YAML config achieved a **~57% cost reduction per agent run**, with identical workflow compliance.

For Claude Code specifically, the recommended split is: **Sonnet 4.6** for fast, routine coding tasks, and **Opus 4.6** (released **February 5, 2026**) for workloads requiring 1M-token context, agent teams (research preview), and state-of-the-art reasoning.

## Query 6: Substack launch strategy first week growth independent writer 2026

Here is a concise summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

**Substack Launch Strategy & First-Week Growth for Independent Writers in 2026**

The core advice for launching on Substack in 2026 is to publish **at least five strong pieces in the first couple of weeks** — not just a welcome post, but content that demonstrates the quality subscribers can expect. Growth fundamentally comes down to three things: getting readers to *discover* you, getting them to *subscribe*, and building *trust*.

Sustainable long-term growth on Substack is not about algorithmic performance or posting volume — "Substack is a **human network**," where traction is created by other writers and readers, and retention is driven by compelling writing. Many new writers struggle because they believe consistency alone creates momentum, but growth only emerges when network relationships and strong writing finally align.

The most effective 2026 tactic reported by independent writers is using **Substack Notes as the primary growth channel** — as little as 20–30 minutes daily has been credited with driving 70% of new subscribers — alongside hosting weekly community "Notes Boosts" and writing a handful of SEO-optimized "hero posts" per quarter to generate passive discovery.

Experts in late 2025/early 2026 also recommend that new writers **prioritize finding a consistent publishing rhythm and delivering value before attempting monetization**, rather than rushing to enable paid subscriptions from day one.

## Query 7: Brussels Belgium small business specialty food retail February 2026

Here is a concise summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

**Brussels/Belgium Specialty Food Retail – Early 2026**

Belgium is considered one of the most competitive grocery retail markets in Europe. In 2025–2026, supermarkets operate in a mature, high-pressure environment shaped by strong discounters, demanding shoppers, and well-developed private label strategies.

Delhaize is set to open seven new supermarkets across Belgium in early 2026, significantly expanding its presence in the Belgian retail market. This signals continued investment in brick-and-mortar food retail despite market pressures.

Starting January 1, 2026, Belgian food and retail companies began enforcing stricter advertising rules, raising the age limit for marketing to minors from 13 to 16. Products that do not meet defined nutritional criteria may no longer be promoted to children or young people under 16, per the Belgian Food Industry Federation (Fevia). This directly affects how small specialty food retailers in Brussels can market their products.

On the trade side, **Tavola** — a premium exhibition focused on fine food and value-added products — has its next confirmed edition on **March 15–17, 2026**. While Brussels is the capital, many high-impact B2B food fairs take place in Ghent and Mechelen, which are often preferred for professional trade events due to better logistics.

## Query 8: AI coding workflow discipline architecture enforcement Cursor rules February 2026

Here is a concise summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

**AI Coding Workflow Discipline & Architecture Enforcement via Cursor Rules (Early 2026)**

The dominant theme going into 2026 is a more disciplined "AI-assisted engineering" approach — leveraging AI aggressively while staying accountable for the software produced, with an emphasis on planning before generating code rather than throwing vague prompts at an LLM.

A key structural shift is that a single `.cursorrules` file is no longer considered sufficient; practitioners have moved to a dedicated `.cursor/rules/` folder for modular, maintainable rule sets. Rules enforce architecture by pinning instructions to a project, user, or team — stored as versioned `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` inside the repo, global user rules via Cursor Settings, team rules via the team dashboard, or an `AGENTS.md` file for agent-specific rules.

A February 10, 2026 post from EclipseSource identified a critical "invisible blocker": when AI output is poor, the real problem is usually stale project context files (`.cursor rules`, `.claude`, Copilot instructions), not the generation itself — and the fix is treating these context files as shared team artifacts that require ongoing maintenance, not one-off setup.

On the platform side, Cursor's 2026 release introduced a subagent system for parallel processing of complex tasks, and Salesforce's adoption reportedly achieved over 30% faster velocity and double-digit code quality improvements across 20,000 developers.
