## Query 2: Claude Code new features release February March 2026

Based on the search results — primarily from Anthropic's official GitHub releases page, the official Claude Help Center, and tracking sites like releasebot.io and claudelog.com — here is a summary of the most notable recent Claude Code updates:

---

**Claude Code: Key New Features (February–March 2026)**

As of **February 26, 2026**, Claude Code gained **auto-memory**, automatically saving useful context across sessions (manageable via `/memory`), and a new `/copy` command that shows an interactive picker when code blocks are present, letting users select individual blocks or the full response.

On **February 21, 2026**, a significant update introduced a `--worktree (-w)` flag to start Claude in an **isolated git worktree**, subagent support for worktree isolation, and a `Ctrl+F` keybinding to kill background agents (with a two-press confirmation). The same update also added a `ConfigChange` hook event, allowed simple mode (`CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE`) to include the file edit tool (not just Bash), and improved startup performance by removing eager loading of session history.

Other recent additions include **HTTP hooks** (POSTing JSON to a URL and receiving JSON back instead of running a shell command), new account environment variables (`CLAUDE_CODE_ACCOUNT_UUID`, `CLAUDE_CODE_USER_EMAIL`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ORGANIZATION_UUID`), and an upgraded `/model` picker showing human-readable labels instead of raw model IDs.

On the model side, **Claude Sonnet 4.6** launched with full upgrades across coding, computer use, long-context reasoning, and agent planning, including a **1M token context window in beta**.

## Query 3: AI game development procedural generation tools solo dev March 2026

Here is a concise summary of the most relevant recent findings on AI game development procedural generation tools for solo devs, as of early 2026:

---

For solo developers in 2026, a practical AI toolchain for an RPG combines **Scenario** (sprite generation), **Leonardo AI** (textures), **Inworld AI** (NPC dialogue), **Replica Studios** (voices), **AIVA** (soundtrack), and **Cascadeur** (animation). Leonardo.ai has evolved beyond simple image generation into specialized, seamless tileable texture mapping, while Inworld AI enables NPCs with real-time reactive "brains" — making static dialogue trees increasingly obsolete. **Meshy** (text-to-3D modeling) is also highlighted as a key tool, addressing what has historically been the slowest part of the pipeline — generating high-quality 3D assets from text prompts. The broader AI-in-gaming market reached **$4.54 billion in 2025** and is projected to grow to **$81.19 billion by 2035** at a CAGR of 33.57%, with the AI game generator/asset creation segment expanding even faster.

- https://www.jenova.ai/en/resources/ai-game-generator *(~March 2026)*

> **Note:** No single article specifically dated **March 2026** surfaced; the most current results are from January–March 2026. For the latest procedural generation breakthroughs (e.g., specific version releases or pricing changes in tools like Meshy or Scenario), checking those tools' changelogs directly would give the most precise data.

---

**Vibe Coding + Game Engines + AI Asset Generation (2025–2026)**

Several "vibecoding-first" platforms have emerged — including **Jabali**, **Rosebud**, and **Kitbash** — in which game code is mostly generative, paired with either imported assets or GenAI-generated assets. Third Point Ventures notes that copilots and vibe coding are expected "to take over most of the programming tasks of an engine in the very immediate future."

**Rosebud AI** offers a free, online vibe-coding tool that generates complete 2D, 3D, VR, and multiplayer games from natural language prompts, powered by Three.js and React — including a built-in AI asset generator for professional 2D and 3D game assets requiring no design skills.

**Gambo** bills itself as "the world's first game vibe coding agent," creating complete, playable, and monetized games from a single prompt in minutes — with all game assets AI-made, organized, and ready to use, plus built-in ad network monetization requiring no extra setup.

A January 8, 2026 post on the **Vibeforge Blog** describes AI now generating complete game systems (movement controllers, inventory systems, dialogue trees) from descriptions, with AI agents capable of playtesting games, finding bugs, and suggesting design improvements automatically.

## Query 8: Lucia self-employed artist freelance Belgium tax social security 2026

Here is a concise, well-sourced summary of the most relevant findings for a self-employed/freelance artist in Belgium in 2026:

---

**Belgium: Self-Employed Freelance Artist — Key Facts for 2026**

**Social Security Contributions:**
Each quarter, self-employed individuals must pay **20.5% of their net taxable income** (after deduction of business expenses) in social security contributions. The minimum quarterly payment for student entrepreneurs in 2026 is **€98.51**, and self-employed students earning less than €8,687.04 net can request an exemption.

**Income Tax Brackets (2026, on 2025 income):**
Belgium applies four progressive income tax brackets — **25%, 40%, 45%, and 50%** — on the net taxable amount remaining after VAT, professional expenses, and social security contributions are deducted. The tax-free allowance in 2026 (for 2025 income) is **€10,910**; if your net taxable income is below this, no income tax is owed.

**Key 2026 Policy Updates (including for creatives):**
The government had promised a gradual increase of the tax-free allowance from €10,910 (2025) to €15,300 by 2029, but this has been **postponed until 2030** — bad news for low-income starters who would have been exempt. Additionally, from January 2026, **VAT on certain "entertainment" services** increases from 6% to 12%, which may affect artists depending on their activity type. Starting in 2026, a few changes also affect **creative entrepreneurs specifically**: IT professionals can invoice under the copyright scheme again, but **flat-rate cost deductions may be abolished** (official confirmation still pending).

**Mandatory e-Invoicing from 2026:**
From 2026, **e-invoicing via Peppol is mandatory** for all B2B invoicing between Belgian VAT-registered self-employed professionals, including part-time self-employed and small businesses.
