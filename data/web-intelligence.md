## Query 1: Cursor custom modes feature release February 2026

Based on the search results, here is a concise summary:

---

**Cursor Custom Modes — Released in Version 0.48.x**

Cursor's 0.48.x release introduced chat tabs for parallel conversations, a redesigned modes system with **custom modes**, and improvements to cost visibility, indexing performance, and MCP reliability. **Custom modes (beta)** allow users to compose new modes with custom tools and prompts tailored to their workflow, and can be enabled via **Settings → Features → Chat → Custom modes**. Users can also set a default chat mode from the same settings panel.

As part of this release, the built-in modes were streamlined — "Edit" was renamed to "Manual" to better reflect its behavior, and Ask mode now has access to all search tools by default, removing the need for the explicit `@Codebase` tool.

**Key sources:**
- Official Cursor changelog for 0.48.x: https://cursor.com/changelog/0-48-x
- Cursor custom modes documentation: https://docs.cursor.com/chat/custom-modes

> **Note:** The search results did not surface a specific February 2026 date tied to the custom modes release — the 0.48.x changelog page does not display an explicit publish date. If you need the precise release date, the official changelog at **cursor.com/changelog** is the most reliable reference.

## Query 2: Cursor IDE changelog update February 24 2026

Based on my research, there is **no specific Cursor IDE changelog entry dated February 24, 2026**. February 24, 2026 is also a future date (it has not yet occurred as of my knowledge cutoff). Here is a summary of the most recent verified Cursor updates surrounding that timeframe:

---

**Cursor IDE – Latest Updates (February 2026)**

The most recent Cursor changelog entry is dated **February 18, 2026**, introducing the ability to hand off plans from the CLI to the cloud, in-line rendering of ASCII diagrams, and various quality-of-life improvements.

Prior to that, on **February 12, 2026**, Cursor launched long-running agents — now available at `cursor.com/agents` for Ultra, Teams, and Enterprise plans — enabling autonomous work over longer horizons to complete larger, more complex tasks with fewer follow-ups.

In terms of version numbers, the latest known build is **version 2.5.20**, released **2026-02-20**, followed by version 2.5.17 (2026-02-17) and 2.4.37 (2026-02-14).

> ⚠️ **Note:** No changelog entry specifically dated **February 24, 2026** was found. Either the update had not been published at the time of the search, or no release occurred on that exact date. The most recent confirmed release prior to February 24 was version **2.5.20 on February 20, 2026**.

## Query 3: Superpowers Cursor skill framework update February 2026

Here is a concise factual summary based on the most relevant recent findings:

---

**Superpowers (obra/superpowers) — Cursor Integration & February 2026 Status**

Superpowers is a complete software development workflow system built specifically for coding agents, and has accumulated **55,000+ GitHub stars**. It was officially accepted into the **Anthropic marketplace on January 15, 2026**, and is described as an open-source agentic framework that transforms Claude Code into a structured senior AI developer workflow.

Installation now differs by platform: **Claude Code and Cursor have built-in plugin marketplaces**, while Codex and OpenCode require manual setup. A dedicated Cursor adaptation (`chauchakching/superpowers-cursor`) exists on GitHub, implementing **14 skills** (brainstorming, test-driven development, systematic debugging, parallel agents dispatch, etc.) via a `sessionStart` hook that automatically injects the `using-superpowers` skill at the start of every conversation.

The framework's DeepWiki documentation was **last indexed on February 20, 2026** (commit `a0b9ec`), indicating active ongoing development as of that date.

**Key Sources:**
- GitHub (main repo): https://github.com/obra/superpowers
- Cursor-specific adaptation: https://github.com/chauchakching/superpowers-cursor
- DeepWiki docs (indexed Feb 20, 2026): https://deepwiki.com/obra/superpowers

> ⚠️ **Note:** No official Superpowers changelog or press release specifically titled "February 2026 update" was found. The above reflects the most current verifiable state of the framework as of late February 2026 based on available indexed sources.

## Query 4: micro-SaaS founder selling small business Belgium 2026

Based on my research, there is no single prominent news story specifically about **one Belgian micro-SaaS founder selling a small business in 2026** — but here is a well-sourced summary of the most relevant findings across the Belgium SaaS ecosystem and the micro-SaaS acquisition market heading into 2026:

---

### Summary

Belgium's SaaS ecosystem is sizable, with **1,666 SaaS startups** recorded as of December 2025, including notable names like Odoo, Deliverect, and Collibra — three of which have reached unicorn status.

On the acquisition side, the **Acquire.com Biannual Acquisition Multiples Report (January 2026)** found that most SaaS acquisitions occur for businesses with an enterprise value **below $10 million**, and that profitable SaaS businesses consistently attract more buyer interest, receive more offers, and close faster than unprofitable ones. Public SaaS revenue multiples declined from an average of **17× in 2022** to roughly **5.5× by end of 2025**, though profitable businesses on platforms like Acquire.com proved more resilient.

Looking at the broader micro-SaaS market, industry experts expect acquisition multiples to **stabilize in the 6–8× ARR range** in 2026 as the market matures, with AI-native micro-SaaS products potentially commanding higher multiples due to their scalability and reduced maintenance requirements. Acquisition multiples have already climbed from 4× to 5–7× ARR, hybrid pricing models now dominate **68% of successful launches**, and bootstrapped founders are hitting break-even in just **10–12 months**.

- Tracxn Belgium SaaS (Dec 2025): https://tracxn.com/d/explore/saas-startups-in-belgium/

> ⚠️ **Note:** No specific viral or widely-reported story of a single Belgian micro-SaaS founder selling their business in 2026 surfaced in these results. If you're researching a specific founder or deal, sharing their name or product name would help narrow the search significantly.

## Query 5: specialty food shop acquisition Belgium Brussels 2026

Here is a concise factual summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

**Delhaize / Delfood Acquisition — Belgium, 2026**

On **26 January 2026**, the Belgian Competition Authority (BCA) approved the acquisition by **Delhaize** of **Delfood**, owner of the **Louis Delhaize** retail chain, subject to conditions including the divestment of a number of proximity stores and petrol station shops in certain local markets. The acquisition covers all Louis Delhaize stores and other stores supplied by Delfood — **303 stores in total** — plus logistics services and headquarters in Belgium, with Delhaize strengthening its position in the convenience segment of the Belgian market.

As a condition of approval, Delhaize must transfer **six Delfood neighbourhood stores** (Zaffelare, Antwerp Nassau, **Franklin Roosevelt Brussels**, Alma, Messancy, and Sint Maria Oudenhove) to another player, as well as one Delhaize Shop&Go at Antwerp Central Station. Ahold Delhaize has since confirmed that Delhaize Belgium **finalised** the purchase of Delfood, though financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

## Query 6: AI agent workflow enforcement multi-pass thinking Cursor rules February 2026

Here is a concise, well-sourced summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

## AI Agent Workflow Enforcement, Multi-Pass Thinking & Cursor Rules (Early 2026)

The dominant theme across early 2026 is enforcing structured, multi-pass reasoning in AI agent workflows through Cursor's Rules/Skills system. Here are the key findings:

**Cursor's Composer 1.5 — Multi-Pass "Thinking" Model (February 2026)**

Cursor's Composer 1.5 is a thinking model that generates "thinking tokens" to reason about the user's codebase and plan next steps before acting. These thinking stages are described as "critical to the model's intelligence." It balances speed with depth: responding quickly on easy problems with minimal thinking, while on hard problems it "will think until it has found a satisfying answer." To handle longer-running tasks, Composer 1.5 also has the ability to self-summarize, allowing the model to continue exploring for a solution even when it runs out of available context — this self-summarization may trigger several times recursively on hard examples. Composer 1.5 was built by scaling reinforcement learning 20x further on the same pretrained model, with post-training compute that actually surpassed the amount used to pretrain the base model.

**Cursor Rules as Workflow Enforcement (January–February 2026)**

Cursor's official agent best practices blog (published January 9, 2026) describes Rules as "persistent instructions that shape how the agent works with your code" — always-on context the agent sees at the start of every conversation. The recommended modern structure is to use the `.cursor/rules/` directory with modular, domain-specific `.mdc` rule files (with metadata frontmatter) rather than a single monolithic `.cursorrules` file, which is considered "unmanageable and prone to context loss."

**Multi-Pass Enforcement via Decoupled Creation + Verification**

A key enforced workflow pattern in 2026 is decoupling creation from verification: rather than asking the agent to "create this component and make sure it follows the rules" in one pass (which causes it to gloss over rules), developers split this into two distinct slash commands — one focused purely on implementation, and a second verification pass run before accepting the output.

**Agent Skills v2.4 — Dynamic, On-Demand Reasoning Capabilities (January 2026)**

Cursor added support for the Agent Skills open standard in version 2.4 (January 2026). Unlike Rules (which are always active), Skills are loaded dynamically when the agent decides they're relevant, keeping the context window clean while giving the agent access to specialized, multi-step capabilities on demand.

- iBuildWith.ai — Cursor Rules vs. Skills vs. Commands: https://www.ibuildwith.ai/blog/cursor-rules-skills-and-commands-oh-my-when-to-use-each

> **Note:** The exact phrase "multi-pass thinking" does not appear to be an official Cursor term — it is best understood as Composer 1.5's variable-depth "thinking token" generation combined with the community practice of enforcing multi-step plan-then-verify agent workflows via Cursor Rules and Skills.

## Query 7: Anthropic Claude API access restrictions OAuth crackdown developer impact February 2026

Based on the search results, here is a concise, well-sourced summary:

---

Anthropic updated its Claude Code documentation on **February 19, 2026**, to explicitly prohibit using OAuth tokens from Claude **Free, Pro, and Max** subscription plans in any third-party products, tools, or services. Enforcement, however, predates the written policy: on **January 9, 2026**, Anthropic had already deployed server-side safeguards blocking subscription OAuth tokens from working outside their official Claude Code CLI. Teams integrating Claude into their own products must now switch to **API key authentication** and accept usage-based billing instead of subscription passthrough. Simultaneously, developers at Elon Musk's xAI reportedly lost access to Anthropic's Claude models in a separate but related enforcement action tied to their use of the Cursor IDE.

## Query 8: Lucia May 2026 freelance artist Belgium self-employed social security transition

Based on my extensive searches across multiple query variations, I was unable to find any specific, identifiable content about a person or platform named **"Lucia"** in connection with a May 2026 freelance artist / Belgium / self-employed social security transition topic. This combination of terms does not correspond to any specific news article, policy document, publication, or named individual that appears in current indexed sources.

Here is what the search results **do** confirm about the broader topic of **freelance artists and self-employment social security in Belgium in 2026**, which may be the underlying subject of interest:

---

**What is verifiable from recent sources:**

Since 1 January 2024, Belgium introduced new social security rules specifically for artists — both employees and self-employed — including a new **"Attestation of Work in the Arts" (ATA / KWA)**.

Starting in 2026, several changes affect creative entrepreneurs in Belgium: IT professionals can invoice under the copyright scheme again, but flat-rate cost deductions for copyright income may be abolished — with official confirmation still pending as of December 2025.

From 2026, all self-employed individuals in Belgium must send invoices electronically via PEPPOL, which also applies to copyright-based creative invoicing.

For 2026, the standard provisional quarterly social security contribution for a self-employed person starting out in their primary occupation is **€890.42 per quarter** (excluding management fees of 3–4%), reducible to **€459.82** for the first four quarters under certain income conditions.

---

**Regarding "Lucia" specifically:** No results matched a person, tool, platform, guide, or policy named "Lucia" in this context. It's possible "Lucia" refers to a private individual, a niche publication, a local workshop/event, or content not indexed by public search engines. Could you clarify what "Lucia" refers to — e.g., is it a person's name, a platform, a publication, or something else? That would help me search more precisely.
