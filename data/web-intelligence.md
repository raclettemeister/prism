## Query 1: Cursor custom modes feature release February 2026

Based on the search results, here is a concise factual summary:

---

**Cursor Custom Modes — Key Facts**

Cursor's custom modes feature was introduced as a **beta** in **version 0.48**, released on **March 23, 2025** (not February 2026). The release — titled *"Chat Tabs, Custom Modes & Faster Indexing"* — redesigned the modes system and introduced the ability to compose new, user-defined modes with custom tools and prompts.

Custom modes can be enabled via **Settings → Features → Chat → Custom modes**, and users can also set a default mode from the same settings panel.

In v0.48, users can create their own modes, choose the tools, settings, custom instructions, and even specify the model for each mode — giving full control over how AI assistance behaves.

Notably, in a later release (**Cursor 2.1.0**), custom modes were reportedly **removed**, with an 'Export' feature added so users could retrieve their old prompts and instructions.

---

**⚠️ Important caveat:** No search results confirm a specific "Custom Modes feature release" tied to **February 2026** specifically. The custom modes feature originally launched in **March 2025 (v0.48)**. If you're looking for a February 2026 update specifically, it may refer to broader agent/subagent enhancements in Cursor's 2.x series. The most authoritative source is the official changelog:

## Query 2: Anthropic Claude API OAuth enforcement third-party tools update February 24 2026

Here is a concise, sourced summary of the most relevant findings:

---

**Anthropic Claude OAuth Enforcement — Third-Party Tools (Feb 2026)**

Anthropic updated its documentation on **February 19, 2026**, to clarify that using OAuth tokens with third-party tools violates their Terms of Service. The company's Claude Code documentation now states explicitly: "Using OAuth tokens obtained through Claude Free, Pro, or Max accounts in any other product, tool, or service — including the Agent SDK — is not permitted and constitutes a violation of the Consumer Terms of Service," and Anthropic is enforcing this with **server-side blocks and account bans**.

The updated docs draw a hard line: OAuth authentication is "intended exclusively for Claude Code and Claude.ai," and everything else requires **API keys** through the Claude Console or a supported cloud provider. Notably, while the written policy is new, enforcement actually began earlier — on **January 9, 2026**, when Anthropic deployed server-side safeguards blocking subscription OAuth tokens from working outside their official Claude Code CLI.

> **Note:** My knowledge cutoff is early 2025, and the date you specified (February 24, 2026) is beyond it — the above is based entirely on live web search results. No specific February 24 event was found; the major policy update occurred on **February 18–20, 2026**.

## Query 3: Simon Willison agentic engineering patterns chapter 3 February 2026

Based on my research, I can now provide a well-sourced summary. Note that as of the search results (dated ~February 23–24, 2026), Willison had published **two** chapters, not yet a dedicated "Chapter 3." Here's what the evidence shows:

---

**Summary:**

On **February 23, 2026**, Simon Willison launched *Agentic Engineering Patterns*, a new guide collecting coding practices and patterns to help get the best results out of coding agents like **Claude Code** and **OpenAI Codex**. At launch, he published the **first two chapters** of the guide.

Chapter 1, **"Writing code is cheap now"**, addresses the central challenge of agentic engineering: the cost to produce working code has dropped to almost nothing, and how that disrupts existing intuitions about how developers work individually and as a team. Chapter 2, **"Red/green TDD"**, describes how test-first development helps agents write more succinct and reliable code with minimal extra prompting. Willison noted he planned to add more chapters at a rate of **1–2 per week**.

The guide is structured as a "guide" — a new content format on his blog where chapters are designed to be updated over time rather than frozen at first publication — distinguishing *Agentic Engineering* (professional developers using agents to amplify their expertise) from "vibe coding" (non-programmers using LLMs with no attention to the code).

> **Important caveat:** As of the search results (retrieved ~February 24, 2026), only **two chapters** had been published. There is **no evidence of a "Chapter 3"** yet. It may not exist at the time of this search, or it may be at a URL not yet indexed.

## Query 4: Cursor IDE changelog update February 24 2026

Based on the search results, there is **no specific Cursor IDE changelog entry dated February 24, 2026**. The closest available updates are from February 12 and February 18, 2026. Here is a summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

The **February 18, 2026** Cursor release introduced the ability to hand off plans from the CLI to the cloud, in-line rendering of ASCII diagrams, and quality-of-life improvements, including a persistent decision menu when a plan is generated.

The **February 12, 2026** release launched **long-running agents**, enabling Cursor to work autonomously over longer horizons on larger, more complex tasks — planning first and completing difficult work without human intervention. This feature is available at cursor.com/agents for **Ultra, Teams, and Enterprise plans**.

Also in February, Cursor expanded usage by adding two pools — **Auto+Composer** and **API** — and boosted limits for Auto and Composer 1.5 across all individual plans, with a limited-time **6x boost** (through February 16). A new usage-visibility page was added to track both pools and API credits.

## Query 5: micro-SaaS founder methodology AI cockpit workflow published February 2026

I was not able to find any source specifically titled or focused on a **"micro-SaaS founder methodology AI cockpit workflow"** published in February 2026. The closest relevant February 2026 content found is the Medium article by NAJEEB and related pieces on micro-SaaS for solo founders — none of which use the specific "AI cockpit" framing. Here is what the search results do confirm:

---

The most relevant February 2026 publication found is **"From 0 to $2,500: My 6-Step Framework for Building Micro SaaS as a Solo Founder"** by NAJEEB, published in *Write A Catalyst* on Medium in February 2026 (URL: https://medium.com/write-a-catalyst/from-0-to-2-500-my-6-step-framework-for-building-micro-saas-as-a-solo-founder-fba5d545b97c). It argues that building and exiting a Micro SaaS is a game a solo founder can win, contrasting it with traditional IT companies that require massive teams, huge capital, and endless bureaucracy. A companion piece from January 2026 by the same author covers building three Micro-SaaS blueprints using the n8n workflow automation tool, framing the opportunity around "Vertical SaaS" — solving a very specific problem for a very specific industry.

**However**, no source using the specific phrase **"AI cockpit workflow"** as a named micro-SaaS founder methodology published in February 2026 was found across multiple search queries. This exact term may refer to a paywalled article, a niche newsletter, a private community post, or it may not exist under that precise title. I'd recommend searching directly on platforms like **Substack**, **Indie Hackers**, or **Product Hunt** for that specific phrase, or verifying the original source where you encountered it.

## Query 7: Superpowers Cursor skill framework update February 2026

Based on the search results, here is a concise, factual summary:

---

**Superpowers Agentic Skills Framework — Cursor Integration (February 2026)**

The **obra/superpowers** repository — an agentic skills framework and software development methodology — was last indexed on **20 February 2026** (commit `a0b9ec`), with official documentation covering installation on Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, and Codex. On **January 15, 2026**, Superpowers was officially accepted into the Anthropic marketplace, and as of late February 2026, the project has over **55,000 GitHub stars**.

A dedicated Cursor adaptation — **`chauchakching/superpowers-cursor`** — ports the framework to Cursor, featuring a `sessionStart` hook that automatically injects the `using-superpowers` skill at the start of every conversation, along with **14 skills** covering brainstorming, plan writing, TDD, systematic debugging, subagent-driven development, and more. An alternative installation method uses `prpm` (`npm install -g prpm` → `prpm install collections/superpowers`), which leverages the OpenSkills library and progressive disclosure via `AGENTS.md` to allow Cursor to load skills as needed.

## Query 8: Claude Code Windsurf Lovable release notes February 24 2026

Now I have comprehensive information. Let me compile the summary.I now have all the information needed to provide a comprehensive, well-cited summary. Let me compile the findings.

Here is a concise, well-sourced summary of the most relevant recent release notes for **Claude Code**, **Windsurf**, and **Lovable** around late February 2026:

---

## 🔷 Claude Code (Anthropic)

The headline development for Claude Code in this period is a major agent isolation feature. Claude Code v2.1.49 (February 19) and v2.1.50 (February 20) bring native worktree management for agents, six memory leak fixes, and new enterprise hooks. Specifically, v2.1.50 added a `--worktree (-w)` flag to start Claude in an isolated git worktree, added `WorktreeCreate` and `WorktreeRemove` hook events enabling custom VCS setup and teardown, and added support for `isolation: worktree` in agent definitions so agents can declaratively run in isolated git worktrees. The `CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE` mode now also disables MCP tools, attachments, hooks, and `CLAUDE.md` file loading for a fully minimal experience.
