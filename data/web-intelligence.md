## Query 1: Cursor custom modes planner executor setup 2026

Here is a concise summary based on the most relevant recent findings:

---

**Cursor Custom Modes: Planner/Executor Setup**

Inspired by Cline, developer Carl Rannaberg replicated separate **Planner** and **Executor** modes in Cursor using custom modes, each with distinct prompts and tool access. For planning, he uses **Gemini 2.5 Pro** (for its long context window and multi-turn clarification), and for execution, **Claude Sonnet 4** (for speed and iterative debugging reliability).

The Planner mode understands requirements and reads code *without* modifying it, while the Executor mode precisely follows plans without second-guessing them.

Custom modes are currently **in beta** and can be enabled via **Cursor Settings → Chat → Custom Modes**. To add one, use the shortcut **⌘.** or click the current mode at the bottom of the AI pane, then scroll to "Add custom mode."

Cursor also shipped a native **Plan Mode** (announced October 7, 2025), accessible via **Shift + Tab** in the agent input, which lets the agent research the codebase, ask clarifying questions, and produce an editable Markdown plan before executing.

## Query 2: Simon Willison agentic engineering patterns chapter 3 February 2026

Based on the search results, I can now provide a well-sourced summary. Note that the search results consistently show the guide launched with **two** chapters on February 23, 2026 — there is **no evidence of a specific "Chapter 3"** having been published as of the search results available. Here's what the sources do confirm:

---

**Summary:**

Simon Willison launched *Agentic Engineering Patterns* on **February 23, 2026**, publishing the first two chapters as a new type of content on his site called a "guide." The guide is described as "a structured, book-shaped collection of coding practices for professional software engineers using AI coding agents like Claude Code and OpenAI Codex," and explicitly distinguishes *agentic engineering* (experts augmenting their skills) from "vibe coding" (non-programmers fully delegating to LLMs). Each chapter is "effectively a blog post with a less prominent date that's designed to be updated over time, not frozen at the point of first publication," and Willison planned to add chapters at a rate of 1–2 per week. The first two chapters were titled **"Writing code is cheap now"** and **"Red/green TDD"** (simonwillison.net/guides/agentic-engineering-patterns/).

> ⚠️ **Note:** No specific "Chapter 3" of this guide appeared in the search results. The guide may have grown beyond two chapters since launch, but Chapter 3 as a discrete, titled publication was not found in current indexed sources. If you need Chapter 3 specifically, check the live guide index at **https://simonwillison.net/guides/agentic-engineering-patterns/** directly.

## Query 3: Cursor IDE update changelog February 25 2026

Based on the search results, here is a concise factual summary of the most relevant findings around the February 25, 2026 timeframe for Cursor IDE:

---

The closest release to February 25, 2026 was **Cursor version 2.5.25**, released on **2026-02-24** (February 24, 2026). There does not appear to be a specific release dated exactly February 25, 2026.

The **February 18, 2026** changelog entry (part of the 2.5.x series) introduced the ability to hand off plans from the CLI to the cloud, in-line rendering of ASCII diagrams, and quality-of-life improvements — including a persistent decision menu shown when a plan is generated in the CLI.

Earlier in February, on **February 12, 2026**, Cursor introduced **long-running agents** capable of working autonomously over longer horizons to complete larger, more complex tasks; these agents plan before executing and are available at cursor.com/agents for **Ultra, Teams, and Enterprise plans**.

**Key sources:**
- Official changelog: https://cursor.com/changelog
- Version history & download links: https://github.com/oslook/cursor-ai-downloads

> **Note:** No changelog entry is specifically dated February 25, 2026. The nearest release is v2.5.25 (Feb 24, 2026), though its detailed patch notes were not publicly itemized in the available sources.

## Query 4: selling specialty food retail shop Belgium Brussels chain buyer 2026

The most relevant and specific recent finding matching your query is the **Delhaize / Delfood acquisition** in Belgium. Here is a concise factual summary:

---

On **February 2, 2026**, Ahold Delhaize announced that its Belgian brand **Delhaize** completed the acquisition of **Delfood NV**, comprising **303 stores** in Belgium — including all *louis delhaize* stores and those supplied through Delfood — as well as logistics services and the Belgian headquarters.

## Query 5: micro-SaaS founder selling small business exit process Belgium

Here is a concise, factual summary of the most relevant recent findings on the micro-SaaS founder exit/selling process, with the most important sources noted:

---

**Summary:**

Micro SaaS businesses — small, often bootstrapped SaaS companies run by solo founders or tiny teams — are attractively positioned for exits due to low operating costs and high margins, drawing buyers from private equity firms to strategic acquirers. According to a 2024 MicroAcquire report, the average micro SaaS business sells for 3–5× its ARR, with top performers fetching up to 8×; for a business generating $100,000 ARR, that's a potential payout of $300,000–$800,000. The most common sale route is online acquisition marketplaces, where the process is standardized — listings are reviewed, metrics verified, and due diligence conducted — with many deals closing within 60–120 days, depending on documentation quality and financial clarity. One documented micro SaaS exit on Empire Flippers achieved the 2nd highest-ever valuation multiplier for a SaaS business on that platform, reaching a ×57 monthly net profit multiplier, illustrating that exceptional businesses can far exceed the average range.

- Bookman Capital (Nov 27, 2025): https://bookmancapital.io/micro-saas-exit-how-to-maximize-the-sale-in-2026/
- Rick Blyth / Micro SaaS Handbook: https://www.rickblyth.com/selling-and-exiting-your-micro-saas

> **Note on Belgium specifically:** The search did not surface any Belgium-specific micro-SaaS exit guides, legal frameworks, or founder case studies. If you're looking for Belgium-specific legal/tax considerations for selling a small business (e.g., asset vs. share sale, Belgian capital gains treatment), that would warrant a more targeted search on Belgian M&A or SME exit law.

## Query 6: Superpowers Cursor skill framework update February 2026

Based on the search results, here is a concise factual summary:

---

**Superpowers (`obra/superpowers`) — Cursor Integration & February 2026 Status**

**Superpowers** (GitHub: `obra/superpowers`) is an open-source agentic skills framework and software development methodology. Notably, **both Claude Code and Cursor now have built-in plugin marketplaces** for it, while Codex and OpenCode require manual setup.

A community-documented method to use Superpowers in Cursor involves the `prpm` package manager: running `npm install -g prpm` followed by `prpm install collections/superpowers`, which uses the openskills library and progressive disclosure via `AGENTS.md` to allow Cursor to load skills as needed.

According to DeepWiki (last indexed **20 February 2026**, commit `a0b9ec`), the Cursor plugin integrates via Cursor's hook system — specifically a `SessionStart` hook — to inject skill context at session start, and "unlike platforms requiring manual git clones, Cursor handles plugin distribution automatically through its marketplace."

As of **January 15, 2026**, Superpowers was officially accepted into the **Anthropic Claude Code plugin marketplace**. The project is free and open-source under the MIT license, created by Jesse Vincent (`obra`) — not by Anthropic.

**Key sources:**
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/obra/superpowers
- DeepWiki (indexed Feb 20, 2026): https://deepwiki.com/obra/superpowers
- Cursor installation guide: https://deepwiki.com/obra/superpowers/2.2-installing-on-cursor

> ⚠️ **Note:** No *official* Superpowers-specific release notes explicitly dated "February 2026" were found. The February 2026 reference comes from DeepWiki's indexing date of the repo (commit `a0b9ec`), not a named versioned release. If you're looking for a specific changelog entry, checking the [RELEASE-NOTES.md](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) directly on GitHub would be the most reliable source.

## Query 7: All We Got Is Weeks life visualization workshop concept similar projects

The search did not return any results for a specific project called **"All We Got Is Weeks"** as a named workshop or branded product. However, the concept is a well-established genre with several closely related projects. Here is a summary of the most relevant findings:

---

**"All We Got Is Weeks"** does not appear to correspond to a distinct, widely-documented workshop or product under that exact name. The concept it describes — **visualizing one's entire life as a grid of weeks** — is a well-known genre pioneered by Tim Urban. Tim Urban's 2014 Wait But Why post "Your Life in Weeks" popularized the idea of showing all the weeks of a human life on a single chart, and it has since spawned numerous tools and projects.

The most active recent similar projects include:

- **loggd.life** (updated ~1 week ago as of now) offers a free Life in Weeks Visualizer that lets users see their entire life as a grid of weeks and adjust life expectancy based on lifestyle factors, with no signup required.
- **4K Weeks** (4kweeks.com) bills itself as "the original life calendar," offering interactive posters that help people visualize how scarce each week is, with a community focused on motivating purposeful action.
- **lifecalendar.io** allows users to capture significant life milestones, career events, goals, and travels in a weekly grid format.

**Key sources:**
- https://loggd.life/tools/life-in-weeks
- https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html
- https://4kweeks.com/

If "All We Got Is Weeks" refers to a very new, niche, or local workshop, it may not yet be indexed. Could you provide more context (e.g., an organizer name or website) for a more targeted search?

## Query 8: Cloudflare Workers Google Calendar sync integration outage February 2026

Based on the search results, I can provide a clear and accurate summary. Notably, there is **no evidence** of a specific "Cloudflare Workers + Google Calendar sync integration" outage in February 2026 — but there *was* a significant, well-documented Cloudflare outage on February 20, 2026, which would have affected any Workers-based integrations (including Google Calendar sync tools built on Workers). Here is what the sources actually report:

---

**Summary of Findings:**

On **February 20, 2026, at 17:48 UTC**, Cloudflare experienced a service outage when a subset of customers using its **Bring Your Own IP (BYOIP)** service had their routes to the Internet withdrawn via BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), caused by an internal change to how Cloudflare manages IP addresses — not a cyberattack.

Out of 6,500 total advertised prefixes, **25% of BYOIP prefixes were unintentionally withdrawn** between 17:56 and 18:46 UTC, making affected customers' services and applications unreachable from the Internet and causing timeouts and connection failures.

The total disruption lasted approximately **6 hours**, and Cloudflare publicly apologized, acknowledging that the outage "undermined its core promise of delivering a highly resilient network."

Secondary effects included **HTTP 403 errors** on Cloudflare's 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver landing page and **HTTP 429 rate-limit spikes** in Workers AI, meaning Cloudflare Workers-based applications (such as custom Google Calendar sync integrations) would have been among the affected services.

---

**⚠️ Important caveat:** No search results describe a named or distinct *"Cloudflare Workers + Google Calendar sync integration outage"* as a standalone incident. The disruption to any such integration in February 2026 would have been a downstream consequence of the broader BYOIP/BGP outage described above.
