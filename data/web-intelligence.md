## Query 1: Cursor changelog March 2026

Based on the search results, here is a concise, factual summary:

---

**Cursor Changelog — Latest Updates (as of early March 2026)**

As of early March 2026, the most recent official Cursor changelog entries are from **February 2026**, with **no March 2026 releases yet publicly documented**. The latest confirmed releases are:

- **Cursor 2.5 (February 17, 2026):** This release introduces **Plugins** on the Cursor Marketplace, **Sandbox Access Controls**, and **Async Subagents**. Plugins bundle capabilities like MCP servers, skills, subagents, rules, and hooks, with launch partners including Amplitude, AWS, Figma, Linear, and Stripe. Subagents can now run asynchronously, allowing the parent agent to continue working while subagents run in the background, and subagents can even spawn their own subagents — enabling a tree of coordinated work.

- **Bugbot Autofix (February 26, 2026):** Bugbot can now automatically fix issues it finds in pull requests; Autofix runs cloud agents on their own machines to test and propose fixes directly on your PR. Over 35% of Bugbot Autofix changes are merged into the base PR.

- **Cursor 2.4 (January 22, 2026):** Version 2.4 introduced Subagents — independent agents specialized to handle discrete parts of a parent agent's task, running in parallel with their own context, and configurable with custom prompts, tool access, and models.

There is **no specific "March 2026" Cursor changelog entry** available in search results at this time, suggesting no major release has been announced yet for that month.

## Query 2: Claude Code update March 2026 site:anthropic.com OR site:github.com

Based on the search results, here is what I found. Note that **no results specifically dated "March 2026" appeared** from `anthropic.com` or `github.com` — the most recent confirmed updates are from **February 2026** and the live CHANGELOG/Releases pages (which are continuously updated). Here is an accurate, source-backed summary:

---

**Claude Code: Most Recent Updates (as of late February / early March 2026)**

The official Claude Code CHANGELOG on GitHub (`github.com/anthropics/claude-code`) is the primary source for ongoing release notes. Recent updates include fixes for crashes in plan mode when project config was missing default fields, `temperatureOverride` being silently ignored in streaming API paths, and LSP shutdown/exit compatibility issues with strict language servers.

Other recent improvements include better system prompt guidance to steer the model toward dedicated tools (Read, Edit, Glob, Grep) instead of bash equivalents like `cat`, `sed`, and `find` to reduce unnecessary bash usage, along with clearer PDF and request size error messages showing actual limits (100 pages, 20MB).

On the broader platform side, Anthropic's API release notes confirm the launch of **Claude Sonnet 4.6**, a balanced model with improved agentic search performance, lower token consumption, extended thinking support, and a **1M token context window (beta)**. Additionally, API code execution is now **free when used with web search or web fetch**, and sandboxed code execution improves model capability and token efficiency.

An Anthropic blog post ("Enabling Claude Code to work more autonomously") highlights a **checkpointing feature** and a refreshed terminal interface with improved status visibility and searchable prompt history (`Ctrl+R`), while the **Claude Agent SDK** (formerly the Claude Code SDK) now supports subagents and hooks for custom agentic workflows.

## Query 4: AI game development solo dev procedural generation tools March 2026

Here is a concise, source-backed summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

**AI Tools for Solo Dev & Procedural Generation (Early 2026)**

In 2026, **Cursor** has emerged as a leading agentic coding tool for indie developers — unlike traditional autocomplete, it analyzes entire codebases and understands relationships between game systems. Specifically for procedural generation, if you're building a roguelike and need to adjust procedural logic across multiple scripts, Cursor can propose and implement those changes autonomously while explaining trade-offs.

**Google AI Studio** has also become a go-to prototyping tool for indie devs thanks to its generous free tier (1,500 requests/day for Gemini 1.5 Pro) with no recurring subscription fees — making it especially practical for bootstrapped solo developers.

For solo devs building full games, a common 2026 tool stack combines **Scenario** (sprite generation), **Leonardo AI** (textures), **Inworld AI** (NPC dialogue), **Replica Studios** (voices), **AIVA** (soundtrack), and **Cascadeur** (animation).

On the adoption side, while **47.1% of developers use AI tools daily**, only **30% use AI for core development tasks** in game studios — far below the 58% adoption seen in publishing and marketing roles — and 45.7% still distrust AI output.

## Query 5: micro-SaaS builder indie hacker published March 2 2026

I was unable to find any article, post, or publication specifically dated **March 2, 2026** matching the query "micro-SaaS builder indie hacker." My knowledge cutoff and current search results do not surface a document with that exact publication date. Here is what the most relevant recent findings (through late January/early February 2026) do show:

---

The micro-SaaS market is projected to grow from **$15.7B to $59.6B by 2030** (~30% annual growth), with solo founders routinely targeting the **$5K–$50K+ MRR** sweet spot by building hyper-specialized, AI-powered tools — a trend heavily covered in the indie hacker community in early 2026.

A **January 28, 2026** Superframeworks roundup of micro-SaaS ideas for solopreneurs highlights that **most founders spend under $1K before first revenue** thanks to no-code tools and free tiers, with opportunity having shifted from generic tools to niche, AI-powered solutions. (Source: https://superframeworks.com/articles/best-micro-saas-ideas-solopreneurs)

A **January 27, 2026** NxCode guide lists 50 profitable micro-SaaS ideas for 2026 that can be built and launched **without coding**, with one creator reportedly getting their first 10 paying customers within 48 hours of a weekend build. (Source: https://www.nxcode.io/resources/news/micro-saas-ideas-2026)

A Superframeworks article from approximately **one month ago** also covered **YC's Spring 2026 Request for Startups**, identifying 8 ideas indie hackers can realistically build, including focused AI tools priced at **$50–$100/month** that undercut enterprise incumbents.

## Query 6: Belgium Brussels small business employment law March 2026

Here is a concise, sourced summary of the most relevant recent findings on Belgium/Brussels small business employment law changes around March 2026:

---

**Belgium Employment Law: Key Changes for Small Businesses in 2026**

Several important changes to Belgian employment law entered into force on **1 January 2026**, with additional reforms expected to take effect later in 2026. Employers should prioritise immediate compliance actions, particularly updates to internal work regulations, sick-leave and reintegration processes, and payroll systems.

Notably for small businesses: The **Federal Learning Account (FLA) reporting obligation has been formally abolished** — employers are no longer required to register training via a federal platform. Additionally, **regardless of company size**, internal work regulations must now include a procedure for maintaining contact with employees on sick leave.

A **new employer solidarity contribution for primary incapacity for work** applies as of 1 January 2026, though it is **payable only by employers with 50+ employees** (calculated quarterly at 30% of primary incapacity benefits paid for a two-month period). The existing employer accountability contribution for incapacity is being phased out, with its legal basis repealed on **1 April 2026**.

On **wages**, Belgium is introducing a cap: full automatic indexation will only apply to the **first €4,000 of gross monthly salary**, with the portion above that threshold not indexed — though the required legislation was unlikely to be in force before January 2026, meaning many salaries may still be fully indexed during the next major index round. Starting in 2026, Belgium also intends to **progressively reduce the length of unemployment benefits** to encourage quicker reintegration into the labour market, introduced gradually starting with the longest-unemployed, with certain groups remaining protected.

## Query 7: Substack API changes authentication March 2026

Based on my thorough search across multiple queries, I was unable to find any specific, verified announcements or documented changes related to **Substack API authentication changes in March 2026**. Here is what the search results do reveal:

---

**What Is Currently Known About Substack's API & Authentication:**

- Substack does have a **Developer API** that allows users who have agreed to its Terms of Use to retrieve public information on Substack profiles by querying a creator's public LinkedIn handle. To help ensure data quality and reduce spam, not all profiles are queryable — only those that have met certain platform authenticity thresholds. This is the **official** but limited public API, documented at: `https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/45099095296916-Substack-Developer-API`

- For broader access, developers have relied on unofficial/reverse-engineered approaches. There is no official Substack API or documentation for developers covering general use cases, a fact that has frustrated many users.

- Unofficial libraries use **cookie-based authentication**: the TypeScript `substack-api` library uses secure authentication via `substack.sid` cookies, and the Python equivalent works similarly.

- As of the last update to Substack's own support page, they stated: "At this time, we don't have a public API and we don't have a timeline for when/if this would become available."

---

**Bottom Line:** No specific Substack API authentication changes tied to **March 2026** were found in any search results, official announcements, changelogs, or developer community sources. This topic may refer to something that has not yet been publicly announced, is based on speculation/rumor, or may not exist. I'd recommend checking:
- **Substack's official support articles**: https://support.substack.com
- **The API Changelog newsletter**: https://apichangelog.substack.com (which tracks broad API industry news)

If you have a specific source or context for this claim, sharing it would help narrow down the search.

## Query 8: vibe coding game engine AI asset generation 2026 site:reddit.com OR site:ycombinator.com

Here is a concise summary of the most relevant recent findings:

---

**Vibe Coding, Game Engines & AI Asset Generation (2025–2026)**

A 3D game engine explicitly designed for vibe coding with an AI-powered creator interface was discussed on Hacker News in **October 2025**, with community feedback noting it is "limited to already built components and fails on new tasks," but could be improved over time with an asset library and expanded capabilities.

As of **September 2025**, Hacker News users debating the best game engine for vibe coding found that AI models like **Gemini Pro 2.5** "utterly failed" with the Python engine Ursina, and performed "even harder" failures on Panda3D, highlighting significant limitations in AI-driven game development workflows.

A satirical/incremental browser game called **"Vibe Coding Simulator 2026"** appeared on Hacker News approximately **two weeks ago** (circa mid-2025), created by a developer who noted that AI coding and incremental clicker games "feel so similar" — reflecting the cultural moment around AI-assisted development.

A more concrete success story from **July 9, 2025** documented a full AI-coded tower defense game built and published on itch.io, with all code and prompts shared on GitHub — though art assets still relied on free itch.io artists rather than AI generation, underscoring that AI asset generation remains a gap in the pipeline.
