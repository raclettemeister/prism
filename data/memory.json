The *Agentic Engineering Patterns* series is the most relevant ongoing content for Julien's Cockpit work. Non-negotiable keep.\n  - `blog.cloudflare.com` — vinext is a top-tier article. Cloudflare consistently ships technically credible, non-marketing content.\n  - `hnrss.org` — Still the best discovery layer for niche tools (`ai-assert`, `pi`). Quality is variable but cross-feed filtering rescues it. Keep with aggressive slop filtering.\n  - `cursor.com` / `anthropic` (via Web Intel) — Both shipped major features this week. These should be in the feed if not already.\n\n- **WATCH:**\n  - `ft.com` — Three paywalled articles in one run. FT content is high-quality when accessible, but if the scraper cannot get past the paywall, the signal is phantom. Watch for one more run; if still paywalled, deprioritise.\n  - `project-syndicate.org` — Opinion column quality. Useful for geopolitical framing but not for builder signal. Acceptable at low frequency; flag if volume increases.\n\n- **CONSIDER ADDING:**\n  - `latent.space` (Latent Space / swyx) — Referenced twice in last 3 briefings (Feb 24, Feb 25) but not yet a primary feed source. The \"inner loop vs outer loop\" framing from their AINews piece was this week's best mental model. Add.\n  - `addyosmani.com` — Addy Osmani's AGENTS.md piece (Feb 24) was directly actionable. His output is low-volume, high-signal. Add.\n  - Belgian/EU business press (e.g., `retaildetail.eu`) — The Delhaize–Delfood story came through Web Intel, not a feed. For shop sale research, a Belgian retail trade feed would surface acquisition signals earlier.\n\n- **CONSIDER REMOVING:**\n  - FT paywalled content — If access does not improve, remove `ft.com` from the primary scrape and rely on Web Intel for FT stories worth verifying.\n\n---\n\n"

Noise rate acceptable given signal ceiling.\n  - `simonwillison.net` — Three appearances this week. Consistently Tier 1. Every entry has been cited in a Signal or Must-Read.\n\n- **WATCH:**\n  - `hnrss.org` — Cross-feed source, but today's batch included Articles 7, 8, 9 (Pope, mushrooms, Binance) — all zero-relevance noise. The raw HN feed is broad by design; the scoring filter is doing its job, but the noise floor is high.\n  - `ft.com` — Article 5 was paywalled and irrelevant. FT has not contributed usable open content in this run. Value depends on access.\n\n- **CONSIDER ADDING:**\n  - **Indie Hackers** (indiehackers.com) — The micro-SaaS founder methodology query (Web Intel Query 5) surfaced a relevant Medium article but found nothing from Indie Hackers directly. This community is the primary peer signal source for solo founders building micro-SaaS and is currently absent from the feed set.\n  - **Windsurf changelog** (windsurf.com/changelog) — Web Intel surfaced genuinely relevant release data (Claude Sonnet 4.6 in Windsurf, Plan Mode improvements) that would not have appeared without a direct search. If Windsurf remains in consideration as a Cockpit harness alternative, this feed is worth adding.\n  - **releasebot.io** — Aggregates changelogs for Cursor, Claude Code, and other tools in one structured feed. Appeared twice in Web Intel as a reliable secondary source.\n\n- **CONSIDER REMOVING:**\n  - No feed has failed across three consecutive runs with *zero* signal. Hold current set, but ft.com earns a yellow flag if next run produces another paywalled irrelevance.\n\n---\n\n"

Noise rate is high but the ceiling is excellent. The FreeBSD driver article alone was worth the entire feed run.\n- **KEEP**: Web Intelligence queries — the six structured searches (Cursor changelog, Superpowers status, OAuth crackdown, Belgian retail) are doing the work that the article feeds miss. This is the highest-value intelligence layer in the system.\n- **WATCH**: `hnrss.org` — duplicate sourcing with `news.ycombinator.com` is generating redundant noise (Articles 7, 8, 9, 11 all came from this feed). If these are two separate feeds pulling from the same source, consolidate to one.\n- **WATCH**: `ft.com` — the FT article was paywalled with zero extractable content. Either add FT cookie authentication to the crawler or remove this feed. A paywalled source that delivers no content is negative signal — it fills a slot that a real article could occupy.\n- **CONSIDER ADDING**: Belgian Competition Authority / Belgian business press (L'Echo, De Tijd) — the Delhaize/Delfood story was surfaced via web intelligence, not a feed. Belgian business news is structurally absent from the feed layer.\n- **CONSIDER ADDING**: Acquire.com blog — the January 2026 acquisition multiples report was surfaced in web intelligence (Query 4) and is directly relevant to both micro-SaaS valuation and shop-sale context. One post per month, high relevance.\n- **CONSIDER REMOVING**: If `ft.com` remains paywalled for three consecutive runs, drop it. There is no intelligence value in a feed that returns subscription walls.\n\n---\n\n"
