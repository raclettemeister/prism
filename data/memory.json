Noise rate acceptable given signal ceiling.\n  - `simonwillison.net` — Three appearances this week. Consistently Tier 1. Every entry has been cited in a Signal or Must-Read.\n\n- **WATCH:**\n  - `hnrss.org` — Cross-feed source, but today's batch included Articles 7, 8, 9 (Pope, mushrooms, Binance) — all zero-relevance noise. The raw HN feed is broad by design; the scoring filter is doing its job, but the noise floor is high.\n  - `ft.com` — Article 5 was paywalled and irrelevant. FT has not contributed usable open content in this run. Value depends on access.\n\n- **CONSIDER ADDING:**\n  - **Indie Hackers** (indiehackers.com) — The micro-SaaS founder methodology query (Web Intel Query 5) surfaced a relevant Medium article but found nothing from Indie Hackers directly. This community is the primary peer signal source for solo founders building micro-SaaS and is currently absent from the feed set.\n  - **Windsurf changelog** (windsurf.com/changelog) — Web Intel surfaced genuinely relevant release data (Claude Sonnet 4.6 in Windsurf, Plan Mode improvements) that would not have appeared without a direct search. If Windsurf remains in consideration as a Cockpit harness alternative, this feed is worth adding.\n  - **releasebot.io** — Aggregates changelogs for Cursor, Claude Code, and other tools in one structured feed. Appeared twice in Web Intel as a reliable secondary source.\n\n- **CONSIDER REMOVING:**\n  - No feed has failed across three consecutive runs with *zero* signal. Hold current set, but ft.com earns a yellow flag if next run produces another paywalled irrelevance.\n\n---\n\n"

Noise rate is high but the ceiling is excellent. The FreeBSD driver article alone was worth the entire feed run.\n- **KEEP**: Web Intelligence queries — the six structured searches (Cursor changelog, Superpowers status, OAuth crackdown, Belgian retail) are doing the work that the article feeds miss. This is the highest-value intelligence layer in the system.\n- **WATCH**: `hnrss.org` — duplicate sourcing with `news.ycombinator.com` is generating redundant noise (Articles 7, 8, 9, 11 all came from this feed). If these are two separate feeds pulling from the same source, consolidate to one.\n- **WATCH**: `ft.com` — the FT article was paywalled with zero extractable content. Either add FT cookie authentication to the crawler or remove this feed. A paywalled source that delivers no content is negative signal — it fills a slot that a real article could occupy.\n- **CONSIDER ADDING**: Belgian Competition Authority / Belgian business press (L'Echo, De Tijd) — the Delhaize/Delfood story was surfaced via web intelligence, not a feed. Belgian business news is structurally absent from the feed layer.\n- **CONSIDER ADDING**: Acquire.com blog — the January 2026 acquisition multiples report was surfaced in web intelligence (Query 4) and is directly relevant to both micro-SaaS valuation and shop-sale context. One post per month, high relevance.\n- **CONSIDER REMOVING**: If `ft.com` remains paywalled for three consecutive runs, drop it. There is no intelligence value in a feed that returns subscription walls.\n\n---\n\n"

Agentic engineering patterns piece (Feb 23) and Claude C Compiler commentary (Feb 22) both directly relevant. Signal density unusually high this week.\n- `retaildetail.eu` — Belgian retail coverage is precise and actionable. Carrefour Belgium and Ratz market both surfaced here.\n\n**WATCH:**\n- `ft.com` — 3 articles this run, all paywalled, all zero readable content. The FT delivers headlines but no substance without a subscription. Consider whether the feed adds value or just noise volume.\n- `hnrss.org` — High volume, variable quality. Today: 1 excellent (FreeBSD driver), 1 directly relevant (Google/OpenClaw), 4 filtered as noise. HN quality is article-dependent, not feed-dependent. Keep but filter aggressively.\n\n**CONSIDER ADDING:**\n- `retaildetail.eu` (if not already a primary feed — it punched above its weight today)\n- A direct Cursor changelog feed (cursor.com/changelog) — Web intelligence had to reconstruct v2.5 details from third parties. The primary source would be cleaner.\n- `blog.fsck.com` — Jesse Vincent's Superpowers release notes. v4.3.0 bug fix was critical information that came via web intelligence, not feed.\n\n**CONSIDER REMOVING:**\n- `ft.com` — Three consecutive runs with paywalled content and no extractable signal.
