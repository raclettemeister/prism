      "report": "FEED HEALTH REPORT\n\n**KEEP:**\n- `news.ycombinator.com` — Delivered Articles 1, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21. Highest signal density this week. Article 1 (Boris Tane's Claude Code workflow) alone justified the entire feed run.\n- `simonwillison.net` — Consistently Tier 1 for AI dev signal. Yesterday's Codex harness piece, today's adjacent tooling. Keep as primary AI engineering source.\n- `mshibanami.github.io` — Surfaced Superpowers (Article 18). Niche but precise. Keep.\n\n**WATCH:**\n- `ft.com` — Four paywalled articles in a single run, all returning subscription walls. The FT feed is delivering headlines, not content. Either acquire an FT subscription and configure full-text extraction, or accept that ft.com is a geopolitics headline ticker, not a content source.\n- `hnrss.org` — Article 2 (Karpathy tweet) scored 7.6/10 despite returning a blank page. Scoring logic needs to penalize zero-content retrievals, not reward cross-feed citation count on empty pages.\n\n**CONSIDER ADDING:**\n- `boristane.com` — Article 1 was the highest-utility piece in today's run. Not currently in the feed. Add directly.\n- `dbreunig.com` — Article 11 (Claude/Electron analysis) is exactly the kind of analytical AI-builder content PRISM needs more of. Currently not in feeds.\n- `thenewstack.io` — Surfaced in web intelligence (Sonnet 4.6 launch coverage) but not in feeds. Reliable AI infrastructure reporting.\n\n**CONSIDER REMOVING:**\n- Nothing permanent yet. Give ft.com one more week — if the next three runs return paywalled content only, remove or downgrade to headline-only tier.\n\n---\n\n"

      "report": "FEED HEALTH REPORT\n\n**KEEP:**\n- `hnrss.org` — 4 for 4 today. Every HN Show HN item was actionable or trackable. Highest signal-to-noise source this run.\n- `theguardian.com` — 1 article today, geopolitically relevant, fully readable.\n\n**WATCH:**\n- `ft.com` — 4 articles today, 4 paywalled, 0 readable content extracted. Titles occasionally useful as weak signals. Recurring problem across multiple runs. This is becoming a structural issue, not a one-off.\n\n**CONSIDER ADDING:**\n- **Anthropic changelog / release notes** — The Claude pricing and model updates in web intelligence were critical this week. There is no feed currently capturing this.\n- **Roo Code GitHub releases** ([github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/releases](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/releases)) — v3.47 dropped Feb 5 with no coverage in the article feed. PRISM caught it only via web intelligence.\n- **RetailDetail EU** ([retaildetail.eu](https://www.retaildetail.eu)) — The 4 Feb Brussels footfall report was relevant. A Belgian retail-focused feed would be useful for Chez Julien context.\n- **Substack Grow** or creator economy newsletters — The Dishwasher Generation launches today; no feed currently covers Substack strategy.\n\n**CONSIDER REMOVING:**\n- `ft.com` — If paywalled content continues for a 4th consecutive run with no readable body text, remove or replace with a free equivalent (e.g., The Economist free articles, Reuters, Politico Europe).\n\n---\n\n"

      "report": "FEED HEALTH REPORT\n\n**KEEP:**\n- `simonwillison.net` — Consistently highest-signal technical content. Every tool recommendation this week traced back to Simon.\n- `hnrss.org` — Delivered Nerve (Show HN) and token anxiety essay today. Raw signal, low noise.\n- `the-decoder.com` — ETH Zurich research, WebMCP — reliable academic/technical sourcing.\n- `oneusefulthing.org` — Ethan Mollick's Models/Harnesses/Agents framework was directly usable.\n\n**WATCH:**\n- `ft.com` (both FT feeds) — **High priority concern.** Both articles today scored 4.4/10 and returned zero usable content due to paywall. FT is generating CrossFeedCounts of 3 (multiple feeds agree it's important) but PRISM literally cannot read it. This is worse than a low-quality feed — it's a *false positive* that burns scoring budget. Either get FT API access or remove these feeds in PRISM v2.0.\n- `marktechpost.com` — Flagged as slop-risk in feedQuality data (0 human, 0 slop checked Feb 18 — needs more samples).\n\n**CONSIDER ADDING:**\n- **Euronews Business** (`euronews.com/business`) — Delivered the Lagarde/ECB succession story with full content today. European-focused financial news without a paywall. Directly relevant to your Brussels context.\n- **GZERO Media** (`gzeromedia.com`) — Delivered the MAGA/Europe analysis with full content. Geopolitical analysis by Ian Bremmer's team — Economist-style, no breathlessness.\n- **w.media or BeBeez** — Caught the Anthropic $30B story. Worth adding one European tech funding tracker.\n\n**CONSIDER REMOVING:**\n- **FT feeds (both)** — Unless PRISM v2.0 gets FT API credentials, remove them. They create false signal (CrossFeedCount inflation) without delivering readable content. The signal they're picking up is real — but PRISM can't access it, and other feeds cover the same stories.\n\n---\n\n"
