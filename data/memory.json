The Boris Tane article (Score 10/10) is the best piece in the last three briefings.\n- **Curated GitHub sources (mshibanami.github.io)** — `obra/superpowers` arrived through this channel. Small feed, high hit rate.\n- **The Guardian** — France/US diplomatic story (Article 7) was clean, fully extractable, and geopolitically relevant. Earns its place.\n\n**WATCH:**\n- **ft.com** — Five articles today, five paywalls, zero content. The FT's value in PRISM depends entirely on whether the RSS feed delivers article text or just headlines. Today: zero text. If this pattern holds for a third consecutive run, it should be deprioritised or replaced with a free mirror source for the same analytical coverage (e.g., Project Syndicate, VoxEU).\n\n**CONSIDER ADDING:**\n- **VentureBeat AI** — Surfaced twice in web intelligence (Sonnet 4.6 benchmark story, Cockpit cost validation) but not in the feed. Clean, technical AI coverage with verifiable claims. Low slop rate.\n- **RetailDetail EU** — The Brussels food market story came from web intelligence, not the feed. For Chez Julien's competitive context, this is a directly relevant Belgian retail trade publication.\n- **boristane.com / practitioner dev blogs** — The Boris Tane article arrived via HN. A small curated list of practitioners writing about AI-assisted development workflows (no products to sell, long-form, evidence-based) would consistently produce Cockpit-relevant signal.\n\n**CONSIDER REMOVING:**\n- **ft.com** — Third consecutive run delivering paywalled-only content. Flag for removal after one more run. Replace with Project Syndicate or VoxEU for equivalent analytical depth on European economics and trade.\n\n---\n\n"

Signal-to-noise is high when filtered to technical projects. Tier 3 in the scoring but consistently outperforming Tier 2 on practical relevance.\n  - `theguardian.com` — One of five articles usable. Adequate for geopolitical coverage. Keep but don't weight heavily.\n  - `simonwillison.net` — Yesterday's Codex harness article was the briefing's Signal. Tier 1, confirmed high value. Keep.\n\n- **WATCH:**\n  - `ft.com` — Five articles submitted today, five paywalled with zero content. This has been a recurring pattern. The feed is capturing FT headlines but delivering nothing to the pipeline. This is a structural problem, not a bad day.\n\n- **CONSIDER ADDING:**\n  - `releasebot.io/updates/cursor` — Surfaced in web intelligence for Cursor changelog. Clean, versioned, timely. Directly relevant to Julien's primary coding environment.\n  - `docs.roocode.com/update-notes/` — Roo Code release notes. Version 3.47.0 (Feb 5) was significant (tool renames, provider cleanup). Julien's primary AI coding harness should have a direct feed.\n  - `github.com/obra/superpowers` — Today's highest-signal item came from a GitHub repo, not a publication. Consider adding a curated GitHub trending feed filtered to AI coding tools.\n  - `levelup.gitconnected.com` — Surfaced in Query 8 with substantive vibe coding / architecture content. Relevant to standing PRISM interests.\n\n- **CONSIDER REMOVING:**\n  - `ft.com` — Unless FT authentication can be added to the pipeline, this feed is generating structured noise: real articles, real headlines, zero content. Five consecutive paywalled submissions with no usable signal represents a structural failure, not occasional friction. Either solve the access problem or remove it from the nightly crawl.\n\n---\n\n"

Even the noise is findable and filterable. Cross-feed endorsements (Boris Tane at 3x) are a reliable quality signal.\n  - `mshibanami.github.io` — Surfaced `obra/superpowers` (score 7.7/10) independently of HN. Small feed, high hit rate on Cockpit-relevant material. Keep and watch.\n  - `simonwillison.net` — Yesterday's THE SIGNAL source. Not in today's article set but produced the most actionable content in the Feb 22 briefing. Consistently high quality.\n\n- **WATCH:**\n  - `ft.com` — Five paywalled articles with zero readable content in today's set. The FT feed is generating headline slots with no substance. This is the third consecutive briefing where FT content has been partially or fully inaccessible. If FT does not have a feed configuration that bypasses the paywall, these slots are dead weight.\n  - `theguardian.com` — One article today (Deranque/France). Content was accessible and relevant. Quality is there when it appears, but volume is low.\n\n- **CONSIDER ADDING:**\n  - `boristane.com` or similar practitioner blogs — Today's highest-scored article came from a personal blog, not a publication. The signal density in \"how I actually use AI coding tools\" practitioner writing is high and not currently covered by any dedicated feed. Consider adding Simon Willison's links feed or a curated list of AI practitioner bloggers.\n  - Belgian/EU economic news source — Nothing in today's feed covered the Ratz food market opening or Belgian consumer confidence directly. RetailDetail EU (source cited in web intelligence) appears to cover Belgian retail specifically. Worth adding.\n  - EU AI Act / EU regulatory tracker — The GDPR angle appeared twice today (LinkedIn, diving instructor) but from HN, not a dedicated EU regulatory feed. A source like `euractiv.com` or `iapp.org` would surface EU compliance developments earl"

Article 1 (Boris Tane's Claude Code workflow) alone justified the entire feed run.\n- `simonwillison.net` — Consistently Tier 1 for AI dev signal.

Either acquire an FT subscription and configure full-text extraction, or accept that ft.com is a geopolitics headline ticker, not a content source.\n- `hnrss.org` — Article 2 (Karpathy tweet) scored 7.6/10 despite returning a blank page. Scoring logic needs to penalize zero-content retrievals, not reward cross-feed citation count on empty pages.\n\n**CONSIDER ADDING:**\n- `boristane.com` — Article 1 was the highest-utility piece in today's run. Not currently in the feed. Add directly.\n- `dbreunig.com` — Article 11 (Claude/Electron analysis) is exactly the kind of analytical AI-builder content PRISM needs more of. Currently not in feeds.\n- `thenewstack.io` — Surfaced in web intelligence (Sonnet 4.6 launch coverage) but not in feeds.
