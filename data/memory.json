Today's agents-lint, Recall, Open Timeline Engine, and the vibe coding essay all came through HN. Quality variance is high but volume justifies the noise.\n- **KEEP**: `simonwillison.net` — Tier 1, referenced in prior briefings, not directly sourced today but underpins the agentic engineering pattern context. No change.\n- **KEEP**: `cursor.com/changelog` — verified source for the Cloud Agents update. Reliable for direct product intelligence.\n- **WATCH**: `ft.com` — two articles today, both paywalled with zero readable content surfaced. The FT signal is real but inaccessible. Consider whether the feed delivers enough open-access content to justify the slot, or whether a summary aggregator (e.g., The Browser) would capture the same signal more accessibly.\n- **WATCH**: `blog.google` — Nano Banana 2 was real but marginal for today's context. Google's blog tends toward marketing register. High noise-to-signal ratio for a builder-focused briefing.\n- **CONSIDER ADDING**: `eu-startups.com` — surfaced in web intelligence (Belgian startups to watch 2026) but not in primary feeds. Relevant for European founder context and Brussels ecosystem signal.\n- **CONSIDER ADDING**: `devops.com` — surfaced the Cursor Cloud Agents story with production metrics. Not currently in feed rotation; appeared only via web search.\n- **CONSIDER REMOVING**: No feed has failed three consecutive runs. FT is on notice (see WATCH above).\n\n---\n\n"

Consistent Tier 2 yield. `blog.google` — Nano Banana 2 image model launch is real product news, well-sourced. `amplifying.ai` — the Claude Code tool-choice study is original, empirical, and citable. Keep watching.\n\n- **WATCH**: `ft.com` — Two articles in today's run were paywalled with zero extractable content. The FT signals are structurally relevant (economic nationalism, AI power constraints) but inaccessible. Consider whether the feed justifies its noise-to-signal ratio if paywalling continues. `project-syndicate.org` — One article today (Trump/fascism analysis) was entirely outside Julien's lens. Single data point; watch for recurrence.\n\n- **CONSIDER ADDING**: Belgian/EU food retail trade press (RetailDetail EU delivered the BON/Colruyt centralized kitchen story via web intelligence — not via feed). This is directly relevant to the shop sale prospecting work and is absent from the current feed set. **Tavola trade show calendar** as a one-time lookup. Simon Willison's blog (`simonwillison.net`) — referenced in three consecutive briefings via cross-feed but not apparently a primary feed source. Should be Tier 1.\n\n- **CONSIDER REMOVING**: No feed has hit 3 consecutive low-signal runs yet. FT is on watch. Project Syndicate is on watch.\n\n---\n\n"

The *Agentic Engineering Patterns* series is the most relevant ongoing content for Julien's Cockpit work. Non-negotiable keep.\n  - `blog.cloudflare.com` — vinext is a top-tier article. Cloudflare consistently ships technically credible, non-marketing content.\n  - `hnrss.org` — Still the best discovery layer for niche tools (`ai-assert`, `pi`). Quality is variable but cross-feed filtering rescues it. Keep with aggressive slop filtering.\n  - `cursor.com` / `anthropic` (via Web Intel) — Both shipped major features this week. These should be in the feed if not already.\n\n- **WATCH:**\n  - `ft.com` — Three paywalled articles in one run. FT content is high-quality when accessible, but if the scraper cannot get past the paywall, the signal is phantom. Watch for one more run; if still paywalled, deprioritise.\n  - `project-syndicate.org` — Opinion column quality. Useful for geopolitical framing but not for builder signal. Acceptable at low frequency; flag if volume increases.\n\n- **CONSIDER ADDING:**\n  - `latent.space` (Latent Space / swyx) — Referenced twice in last 3 briefings (Feb 24, Feb 25) but not yet a primary feed source. The \"inner loop vs outer loop\" framing from their AINews piece was this week's best mental model. Add.\n  - `addyosmani.com` — Addy Osmani's AGENTS.md piece (Feb 24) was directly actionable. His output is low-volume, high-signal. Add.\n  - Belgian/EU business press (e.g., `retaildetail.eu`) — The Delhaize–Delfood story came through Web Intel, not a feed. For shop sale research, a Belgian retail trade feed would surface acquisition signals earlier.\n\n- **CONSIDER REMOVING:**\n  - FT paywalled content — If access does not improve, remove `ft.com` from the primary scrape and rely on Web Intel for FT stories worth verifying.\n\n---\n\n"
