# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — Julien
**Generated: 2026-02-22 | For: PRISM Intelligence Briefing**

## 1. RIGHT NOW

Julien is in the immediate aftermath of a productive but expensive coding day (Feb 22). He shipped Chez Julien Simulator, finished the Sweden Odyssey demo, and — most significantly — designed and documented The Cockpit v0.1, his new AI-assisted dev discipline system. Tomorrow (Feb 23) is his public launch day: julien.care + both games go live. Energy is high but tempered by the cost shock of ~€60-70 in a single Roo Code / Opus 4.6 session.

## 2. THIS WEEK — ACTIVE PROJECTS

**🔴 TOP PRIORITY: The Cockpit (v0.1 — JUST BUILT)**
- Created Feb 22. SPEC.md written. First checklist: Daily Coding Session Ritual (9 steps: PRE-FLIGHT / FLIGHT / POST-FLIGHT). Three Laws defined: no code without architecture, no moving forward without iteration, no "done" without review.
- Current state: manual markdown checklists only (v0.1). AI enforcement in Roo Code / Cursor rules planned for v0.3.
- Roadmap runs to v1.0 (full AI enforcement). This is Julien's meta-infrastructure — everything else depends on it.
- Standing PRISM request: surface AI-assisted dev workflows, orchestration frameworks, Cursor/Roo Code best practices, software discipline for non-engineers, AI cost optimization. **1-month recency required.**

**🟢 LAUNCHED: Chez Julien Simulator**
- Complete and shipped Feb 22. No further work needed.

**🟢 SHIPPED: Sweden Odyssey demo**
- Demo finished and playable. Collaborative project with friends. First attempt at coding with discipline (not pure vibing).

**🟡 LAUNCHING TOMORROW (Feb 23): julien.care + The Dishwasher Generation**
- julien.care text/voice getting final polish tonight.
- dishwashergeneration.substack.com going public simultaneously.
- This ends the stealth phase. Julien goes public as a voice on the internet.

**🟡 NEXT: Second Game (Renpy or more advanced)**
- Not started. Will be the first real Cockpit test — proper structure and discipline from day one.

**🟡 Now Page Bot (v1.0 pipeline working — 7 issues pending)**
- Full pipeline confirmed working Feb 21 (run #8). 17-second end-to-end.
- 7 formatting issues documented in SPEC.md. Phase 1 (format.js, resolves 5/7) ready to execute.
- Deploy held until after Feb 23 launch.

**🟡 New: Sales Data (Chez Julien)**
- Started Feb 22. Data gathering and extrapolation of shop sales on business computer. Business intelligence for GPFC srl.

**⚪ PRISM v2.0**
- Spec complete (Feb 18). Multi-pass Haiku+Sonnet, 50 articles, ~€2.50/night budget. Ready for autonomous build via fresh Cowork/Sonnet session. Not started yet.

**⚪ NightCrawler**
- Deployed and operational (Feb 18). Running at 3 AM CET. No active work this week.

**⚪ Staffing Calendar System**
- Live but not viable. Not touching this week. Cron trigger and env vars still pending.

**⚪ Letta Agents (Brain, Coach, Queue)**
- Built Feb 15. Unused since. Parked.

**⚪ Staffing System**
- Explicitly parked.

## 3. PRIORITIES & STRUGGLES

**What matters most (Julien's own words):**
- The Cockpit is #1 across all coding work. Without it, every other project suffers.
- The core problem: Julien vibecodes. Tasks too big, stale conversations, skips architecture, skips iteration, moves too fast. This has to stop.
- The shift: from "talks to AI and hopes for the best" → "orchestrates AI with discipline, structure, and proper process."

**What's hard right now:**
- **Cost discipline**: Spent ~€60-70 in one day on Opus 4.6 for everything. Needs to learn when Opus is worth it (architecture, complex decisions) vs. Sonnet (implementation, routine tasks). Cost-efficiency is now a Cockpit dimension.
- **Vibe-coding reflex**: The temptation to skip architecture and just prompt. The Cockpit exists to fight this.
- **Model selection**: No current framework for choosing between models by task type. This is a gap.

**What he's building toward:**
- Become an operator, not a hobbyist. Orchestrate AI agents with frameworks, not vibes.
- Every coding session follows the checklist. Every project starts with a SPEC. Every plan gets iterated 4-5 times before execution.

**Physical products (emerging interest):**
- Furniture building, new leash design for Poncho. Exploring AI-assisted physical design. Early stage, no active project.

## 4. BUSINESS — CHEZ JULIEN / OPERATION AUTONOMY

**Strategic direction:** Operation Autonomy — make Chez Julien run without Julien's daily presence. Henry is the key investment.

**Henry (24, full-time, 4 months in):**
- More motivated and growth-oriented than Lucas. Targeted for manager-level development within the 6-month runway.
- Feb 14 "Big Meeting" was the role restructure conversation (Henry → manager path, Lucas → customers only). Outcomes not documented in recent files.
- Goal: Henry handles daily ops, reporting (cash, sales, problems, alerts), eventually runs the shop independently.

**Lucas (24, part-time):**
- Good with customers, strategically disengaged from cognitive work. Deliberately conserves energy for his own creative agency and personal projects. Not being developed at the shop — only expected to hold down customer/sales floor.

**New this week:** Sales data project started — Julien pulling and extrapolating shop sales data on the business computer. Business intelligence initiative for GPFC srl. Likely feeds into Operation Autonomy metrics and/or a future software tool.

**Staffing Calendar System:** Live but not viable. Cloudflare Worker deployed, Google Calendar integration scaffolded, but env vars and cron trigger still pending. Not a priority this week.

## 5. TOOLS & STACK

| Tool | Role | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| **Roo Code** | Primary AI coding harness | Active — forces architecture before code. Best harness found so far. |
| **Cursor** | AI coding IDE | Active |
| **Claude Opus 4.6** | Architecture, complex decisions | Expensive — €60-70/day risk. Use selectively. |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.6** | Implementation, routine tasks | ~3x cheaper. Default for most work going forward. |
| **Mac Mini (16GB)** | Only workstation | Primary machine |
| **MyLifeOS (Obsidian + GitHub)** | Vault / OS | Private repo, auto-syncs every 30 min via Obsidian Git |
| **PRISM** | Morning intelligence briefing | v1.3 live, runs 4 AM CET nightly. v2.0 spec ready, not built. |
| **NightCrawler** | Vault health bot | Deployed, 3 AM CET, fully operational |
| **Now Page Bot** | Now-page automation | Pipeline working, 7 issues pending, deploy after Feb 23 |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automation runner | PRISM, NightCrawler, Now Page Bot all run here |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Business tool backend | Staffing calendar system (parked) |
| **Notion** | Shop operations database | Staffing, availability, leaves |
| **Lovable / Vercel** | Frontend deployment | julien.care hosting |

**Cost awareness now explicit:** Julien tracking AI spend as a metric. Opus for architecture/decisions, Sonnet for implementation. This is a new Cockpit discipline dimension.

## 6. LIFE

**Lucia:**
- Artist, currently at International Yehudi Menuhin Foundation. Quitting May 1, 2026 to go self-employed (teaching art, selling art). Julien committed to supporting her financially and with time during this transition.
- Monthly anniversary: 27th. Key date approaching: Feb 27.

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. No specific issues flagged this week.

**Energy/cognitive load:**
- Julien has learned that multi-project vibe-coding creates cognitive debt; single-task creative work energizes him. The Feb 22 heavy coding day was high-output but likely taxing.
- Launch day (Feb 23) is tomorrow — pressure is real but contained. Both deliverables (game + site) are ready.

**Key upcoming:**
- **Feb 23**: Public launch — julien.care, Chez Julien Simulator, The Dishwasher Generation Substack.
- **Feb 27**: Monthly anniversary with Lucia.
- **May 1, 2026**: Lucia quits her job — household income dynamic shifts, support needed.
