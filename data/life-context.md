# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — Julien
**Generated:** 2026-02-25 | **Next update:** when context changes

---

## 1. Right Now

Quiet day — no major sessions logged, no new files. Julien is in a consolidation mode after an intense 2-3 days of system-building. His primary focus is The Cockpit: settling on Cursor + Superpowers + custom skills as his dev workflow harness, with active awareness of its limitations (AI can skip the chain, multi-pass discipline is hard to enforce). Energy is calm; blog delay is noted and accepted without stress.

## 2. This Week — Active Projects

**The Cockpit (HOT)**
- Settled on: Cursor + Superpowers skill set + custom-built skills and rules
- Key limitation acknowledged: `.mdc` rules aren't hard enforcement — AI can skip the Superpowers chain (brainstorming → worktree → plan → TDD → review)
- Built `cockpit-repass` skill: 3 challenge gates (Design Challenge, Plan Quality Check, Review Repass) with "push back once, then respect" rule
- Rewrote `cockpit-core.mdc` to 18 lean lines
- Next step: set up Custom Modes in Cursor (Cockpit Planner = read-only, Cockpit Executor = full access) to mimic Roo Code's hard mode gates
- Still looking for a better cockpit — this is ongoing search, not final answer

**Mixtapes (WARM)**
- Active entries: jazz mess around, Woodstock, Queen Live, Buena Vista Social Club
- All 4 entries refined + STATUS.md updated on 2026-02-23
- Nature of project unclear from logs but consistently touched

**Julien & Lucia — Creative Projects (NEW)**
- New project folder created 2026-02-22
- First project: **All We Got Is Weeks** — workshop where participants visualize life as ~4,160 weeks, paint past with watercolors, decide what to color next
- Early-stage concept, captured in STATUS.md

**Chez Julien Simulator (DONE)**
- Shipped. Complete. Not active.

**Sweden Odyssey (DONE — demo phase)**
- Demo finished. First real test of "learning to code properly." Collaborative project with friends. Not currently active.

**Sales Data / Chez Julien BI (NEW)**
- Data gathering and extrapolation of shop sales started 2026-02-22
- Business intelligence for GPFC srl on business computer

**Renpy Game (PARKED — 1 week)**
- Exciting but postponed. Julien is using the pause to think about what his Renpy cockpit will look like before starting. Not active this week.

**Blog — julien.care (DELAYED)**
- Launch delayed by a few days. Julien is fine with it. Not a crisis.

**Physical Products (EXPLORATORY)**
- Interest in furniture building, new leash design for Poncho, 3D printers
- No active project yet — ideation phase

**Shop Sale Research (UPCOMING)**
- Julien plans a deep research session to find prospects for selling the retail shop
- Target: chains and centralized kitchens
- One multi-cheese place owner already interested
- Not started yet — flagged as next action

## 3. Priorities & Struggles

**What matters most right now:**
- Locking in The Cockpit as a reliable, disciplined dev workflow — not vibe-coding, but structured sequences (like helicopter pre-flight)
- The core insight: a cockpit is a harness + environment + architecture + workflow. Cursor alone isn't enough; the chain must hold.

**What's hard:**
- Multi-pass thinking is difficult to enforce. AI tends to skip chain steps and jump to execution.
- Asking for multiple passes on the same problem is unnatural / hard to maintain discipline on.
- Some things still implemented automatically (`.mdc` rules not fully deterministic)

**What he's watching:**
- Better cockpit alternatives — always on the lookout. Current stack is "good enough, not perfect."
- Cost-efficiency as cockpit dimension: Roo Code was best for enforcement but burned €60-70/day on Opus. Cursor is cheaper but chain discipline is weaker.

**What he's avoiding / deferring:**
- Renpy game (intentional 1-week pause)
- Blog launch pressure (relaxed about the delay)

## 4. Business — Chez Julien

**Strategic direction:** Operation Autonomy — push shop toward full autonomy, develop Henry as manager. Parallel track emerging: Julien is now also researching selling to chains/centralized kitchens. One prospect (multi-cheese place owner) already engaged. This is a real strategic fork: autonomy vs. exit.

**Team:**
- **Henry** — 24 years old, full-time, invested, wants manager path. Soft manager pitch made at Feb 4 team meeting. Training and progressive responsibility handoff ongoing. Still lacks experience and structure.
- **Lucas** — part-time/full-time (ambiguous). Good with customers. Feb 4 meeting framed him as sales focus; creative future hook offered to retain engagement.

**Feb 4 meeting outcome:** Foundation-laying meeting completed. Big Meeting (full role restructure) scheduled for March 2026.

**Staffing Calendar System:** Cloudflare Worker + Google Calendar + Notion integration built and documented (setup guide + test run doc exist). Automated sync every 30 minutes. Status of live deployment unclear from recent logs — may be operational.

**Sales data project:** New BI initiative started 2026-02-22. Julien is extracting and analyzing shop sales data.

**Financial note:** Building ownership (48% of building, 18-year loan) is a factor in any sale/autonomy decision.

## 5. Tools & Stack

| Layer | Tool | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Primary IDE | Cursor | Active — settled |
| Skill framework | Superpowers (14-skill chain) | Active — integrated |
| Custom skills | cockpit-repass, dancing-session, guitar-coach, update-business-status, weekly-business-plan, value-plan-review | Built and in use |
| Enforcement attempt | Custom Modes (Planner/Executor) | Planned — not yet set up |
| Previous harness | Roo Code | Abandoned — too expensive (€60-70/day on Opus) |
| Model preference | Claude (Sonnet for implementation, Opus for architecture/decisions) | Cost-efficiency now a cockpit discipline |
| OS / vault | MylifeOS (Markdown, Cursor-native) | Stable |
| Business ops | Notion | Shop operations and staffing |
| Staffing infra | Cloudflare Workers + Google Calendar API | Built |
| Intel briefing | PRISM (automated morning briefing) | Running |

## 6. Life

**Lucia:**
- Quitting her job May 1, 2026 to go self-employed (art teaching + selling own art)
- Julien's role: support with time and money so she can bloom
- Joint creative projects starting: "Julien & Lucia" project folder created, first project is All We Got Is Weeks workshop
- Meeting anniversary: 27th of each month; yearly anniversary April 27

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. New leash design on Julien's physical products interest list.

**Energy/mood:** Calm. Quiet day. No stress signals. Consolidating after an intense build week.

**Upcoming relevant dates:**
- Lucia's job ends: May 1, 2026
- March 2026: The Big Meeting (Henry/Lucas role restructure)
- Blog launch: imminent (days away)

*Snapshot confidence: HIGH on Cockpit status and direction. MEDIUM on business strategic fork (autonomy vs. sell — both tracks active simultaneously). LOW on Renpy and physical products (too early to read).*
