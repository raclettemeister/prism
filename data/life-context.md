# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — Julien
**Generated:** 2026-02-22 | **For:** PRISM intelligence briefing personalization

---

## 1. RIGHT NOW

Julien is in the immediate aftermath of a dense build day (Feb 22) that produced two major outputs: **Chez Julien Simulator** shipped, **Sweden Odyssey demo** finished, and — most importantly — **The Cockpit v0.1** designed, documented, and live. He's entering the **Feb 23 public launch** (julien.care + games + Substack) with everything ready but final polish still pending. Energy is high but cost-aware: he burned ~€60-70 on Roo Code + Claude Opus 4.6 in a single day and is recalibrating model selection as a discipline issue, not just a budget issue.

## 2. THIS WEEK — Active Projects

**🚀 LAUNCHING TOMORROW (Feb 23)**
- **julien.care** — text and voice need final polish tonight. Ships tomorrow.
- **Chez Julien Simulator** — DONE. Shipped.
- **Sweden Odyssey** — demo finished and playable. Ships for publication.
- **The Dishwasher Generation** (Substack) — launching simultaneously.

**🔧 TOP PRIORITY: The Cockpit v0.1**
- SPEC written. STATUS created. First checklist written: *Daily Coding Session Ritual* (9 steps: PRE-FLIGHT / FLIGHT / POST-FLIGHT).
- Three Laws defined: no code without architecture, no moving forward without iteration, no "done" without review.
- v0.1 = manual markdown checklists. v0.3 = AI enforcement via Roo Code/Cursor rules. v1.0 = full AI enforcement.
- **Standing deep dive request to PRISM:** surface AI-assisted dev workflows, orchestration frameworks, Cursor/Roo Code best practices, software discipline for non-engineers, AI cost optimization for founders. Max 1 month old.

**🤖 Infrastructure (operational, not active this week)**
- **NightCrawler** — deployed, running 3 AM CET, catching issues. ✅
- **PRISM v1.3** — running nightly 4 AM CET. v2.0 spec complete, ready to build. ✅
- **Now Page Bot** — v1.0 pipeline functional (Run #8, Feb 21). 7 formatting issues documented in SPEC.md. Phase 1 fix ready. Deploy after Feb 23 launch.
- **Staffing Calendar System** — live but not viable. Not touching this week.
- **Letta AI agents** (Brain, Coach, Queue) — built Feb 15, unused since.

**🆕 New project: Julien & Lucia — "All We Got Is Weeks"**
- Project folder created Feb 22. Collaborative creative workshop concept: life visualized as ~4,160 week grid, participants paint past with watercolors, decide what to color next.
- Early stage, captured in STATUS.md.

**📊 New project: Sales Data (Chez Julien)**
- Data gathering and extrapolation of shop sales. Business intelligence for GPFC srl. Just started.

**⏭️ Next game (post-launch)**
- Second game coming (Ren'Py or more advanced). Will be the **first real Cockpit test in action** — proper structure and discipline from day one.

## 3. PRIORITIES & STRUGGLES

**What matters most (Julien's own words):**
1. **The Cockpit** is #1 priority across all coding work. Without it, every other project suffers.
2. Feb 23 launch ships tonight/tomorrow. Non-negotiable.
3. The shift: from vibe-coder who hopes for the best → operator who orchestrates AI with discipline.

**The core struggle he named explicitly:**
- Vibecodings. Tasks too big. Stale conversations. Skipping architecture, iteration, review.
- Moving too fast because AI enables it — producing messes as a result.
- Cognitive pattern: excellent at setting up systems, drops off at operational stage.

**What The Cockpit addresses:**
- Always open a new chat. Always read the spec. Iterate architecture 4-5 times before coding. Implement in small pieces. Review before closing.
- Cost discipline: Opus for architecture and complex decisions. Sonnet for implementation and straightforward tasks.

**Physical products interest (emerging, not active):**
- Furniture building. New leash design for Poncho. Exploring AI-assisted physical design. Noted but no active project yet.

## 4. BUSINESS — Chez Julien / Operation Autonomy

**Status:** Operation Autonomy is the active strategy (not selling — pushing shop to full autonomy with Henry as eventual manager). Julien is deliberately stepping back from daily operations.

**Henry** (24, full-time, 4 months in): Key development target. Eager, growing fast, wants responsibility. Goal: manager-level within the Operation Autonomy window. Concrete paths on the table: title upgrade, potential shop takeover, sale terms that retain him, future collaboration, safety net via Julien's network.

**Lucas** (24, part-time/full-time, 2 years): Good with customers, strategically disengaged from cognitive shop work. Runs his own creative agency on the side. Best managed with clear customer-facing tasks, not development projects.

**Team meeting history:** Feb 4 was foundation-laying (mild). "The Big Meeting" (Feb 14, Saturday) was the full role restructure conversation — Henry's development pitch, Lucas's "let your best friend shine" reframe, bonus structure shared (Lucas 4.5%, Henry 2% of sale price).

**Staffing system:** Cloudflare Worker + Notion + Google Calendar integration. Live but incomplete. Not a priority this week.

**Serge** = accountant (external). Monthly admin checklist exists but not flagged as urgent.

## 5. TOOLS & STACK

| Tool | Role | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Roo Code** | Primary AI coding harness | Forces architecture before code. Best harness found so far. |
| **Cursor** | AI-assisted dev environment | Used alongside Roo Code |
| **Claude Opus 4.6** | Complex decisions, architecture | Expensive — ~€60-70/day if overused. Reserve for high-value tasks. |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.6** | Implementation, routine tasks | ~3x cheaper than Opus. Default going forward per Cockpit discipline. |
| **PRISM** | Morning intelligence briefing | 45+ RSS feeds, GitHub Actions, nightly 4 AM CET |
| **NightCrawler** | Vault health bot | 3 AM CET, GitHub Actions, ntfy alerts |
| **Now Page Bot** | Auto now-page updater | Post-launch deploy pending |
| **Obsidian + GitHub** | MylifeOS vault | Auto-sync every 30 min via Obsidian Git |
| **Mac Mini 16GB** | Only workstation | Primary machine for all work |
| **ntfy** | Push notifications | Topic: `mylifeos-business` |

**Model cost discipline (new, from Feb 22):** Opus = architecture + complex decisions. Sonnet = implementation + straightforward tasks. This is now a Cockpit rule.

## 6. LIFE

**Lucia:** Artist, currently at International Yehudi Menuhin Foundation. Quitting May 1, 2026 to go self-employed (art teaching + selling own work). Julien is supporting her transition financially and with time. New joint creative project launched Feb 22: "All We Got Is Weeks" workshop concept under `Projects/Julien & Lucia/`. Monthly anniversary: 27th (next: Feb 27 — 5 days out).

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. Needs daily attention. New leash design interest noted.

**Energy pattern to note:** Single-task creative work (writing, designing) energizes Julien. Multi-project vibe-coding and automation specs create cognitive debt. Feb 22 was a high-output, high-cost day — watch for post-sprint fatigue going into launch day.

**Upcoming critical date:** **Feb 23 = public launch day.** Everything public for the first time. julien.care, both games, Substack all go live simultaneously.

*Snapshot confidence: HIGH. Julien's own words (context note) align tightly with LOG.md entries from last 3 days. No contradictions detected. The Cockpit and Feb 23 launch are the two dominant signals in all sources.*
