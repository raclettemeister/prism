# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — Julien

## 1. RIGHT NOW

Today is Feb 23 — Julien's public launch day. julien.care, the game (Chez Julien Simulator), and The Dishwasher Generation (Substack) all shipped. No journal entry written, but the vault was active all day. Evening was spent on Cockpit documentation refinements (Cursor config README, first-week cheatsheet, superpowers-vs-cockpit comparison doc) and Mixtapes work (Buena Vista Social Club entry added, Queen Live and CALIBRATION.md refined). Launch happened — stealth phase is over.

## 2. THIS WEEK — ACTIVE PROJECTS

**The Cockpit (TOP PRIORITY)**
- v0.1 complete as of Feb 22. SPEC written. First checklist: Daily Coding Session Ritual (9 steps: PRE-FLIGHT / FLIGHT / POST-FLIGHT). Three Laws: no code without architecture, no moving forward without iteration, no "done" without review.
- Cursor config restructured today (Feb 23): old rule files deleted, `cockpit-planning.mdc` and `mylifeos.mdc` added as new global rules.
- Documentation refined tonight: README, first-week cheatsheet, superpowers-vs-cockpit comparison.
- Roadmap: v0.1 (manual checklists, now live) → v0.3 (AI enforcement in Roo Code/Cursor) → v1.0 (full AI enforcement).
- **Standing PRISM request:** Surface anything on AI-assisted dev workflows, orchestration frameworks, Cursor/Roo Code best practices, software discipline for non-engineers, AI cost optimization for founders. Max 1 month old.

**Mixtapes**
- Active work tonight. Collection now at 4 entries: `01-jazz-mess-around.md`, `02-woodstock.md`, `03-queen-live.md`, `04-buena-vista-social-club.md`.
- CALIBRATION.md framework updated. STATUS.md current.

**julien.care / Public Launch**
- Shipped Feb 23. Text/voice got final polish. This is the moment the public presence begins.

**Chez Julien Simulator**
- Finished and shipped (confirmed Feb 22). Game complete.

**Sweden Odyssey**
- Demo finished Feb 22. Collaborative project with friends. First real attempt at coding properly (not vibing).

**Second Game (upcoming)**
- Ren'Py or more advanced platform. Will be the first full test of The Cockpit in action — proper structure and discipline from day one. Not started yet.

**Now Page Bot**
- v1.0 pipeline fully functional as of Feb 21 (run #8). All steps green, 17-second runtime.
- 7 formatting issues documented in SPEC.md. Phase 1 (format.js, fixes 5/7 problems) ready to execute. Phase 2: French translation. Phase 3: auto-deploy investigation.
- **Status: Deploy after Feb 23 launch.** Parked until post-launch.

**PRISM v2.0**
- Spec complete (Feb 18). Multi-pass Haiku+Sonnet, 50 articles, ~€2.50/night budget. Ready for build via fresh Cowork session. Not started yet.

**All We Got Is Weeks (Julien & Lucia)**
- New project folder created Feb 22. Workshop concept: participants view life as ~4,160-week grid, paint past with watercolors, decide what to color next. STATUS.md written. Parked for now.

**Sales Data / Business Intelligence (Chez Julien)**
- New project started Feb 22. Data gathering and extrapolation of shop sales on business computer. Early stage.

## 3. PRIORITIES & STRUGGLES

**What matters most:**
1. The Cockpit — this is the meta-infrastructure for all code work. Without it, every project degrades.
2. Public presence — launch happened today. Now: show up, write, share.
3. Second game — first real Cockpit test.

**The core struggle Julien named:**
He vibecodeshe gives AI tasks that are too big, stays in stale conversations, skips architecture, skips iteration, skips review. The Cockpit is the structural fix. The shift he's making: from someone who talks to AI and hopes for the best → someone who orchestrates AI with discipline, structure, and proper process.

**Cost awareness unlocked:**
Spent ~€60-70 on Roo Code in one day (Feb 22), all on Claude Opus 4.6. Lesson: Opus for architecture and complex decisions; Sonnet for implementation and straightforward tasks. Cost-efficiency is now a Cockpit discipline, not an afterthought.

**What he's avoiding / parked:**
- PRISM v2.0 build (spec ready, not executing yet)
- Now Page Bot Phase 1 fixes (ready, blocked on post-launch timing)
- Staffing Calendar System (live but not viable — env vars, cron, and end-to-end test still pending)
- Staffing system more broadly (explicitly parked)

**Physical product interest (emerging, not active):**
Furniture building, new leash design for Poncho. Exploring AI-assisted physical design. Early curiosity, no project structure yet.

## 4. BUSINESS — CHEZ JULIEN

**Operation Autonomy** is the current strategic frame (replaced Operation Exit — decided not to sell). Goal: shop runs without Julien's daily involvement. Henry is the key person to develop into manager.

**Team situation (as of Feb 4 meeting):**
- Feb 4 meeting was foundation-laying (Option 1). Big Meeting (Option 2 — full role restructure) was targeted for Feb 14 but no log confirmation it happened.
- Henry (24, full-time, 4 months in): eager, growing, motivated to prove himself. Target for manager development. Currently blocked from cognitive work by Lucas grabbing those tasks.
- Lucas (24, part-time, 2 years): good with customers, strategically disengaged from cognitive shop work. Runs his own creative agency on the side. Comfortable arrangement suits him.
- Task flip goal: Henry on thinking/projects, Lucas on customers only.

**Staffing Calendar System:**
- Cloudflare Worker + HTML dashboard + Google Calendar ↔ Notion sync. Deployed Feb 17 but NOT fully operational. Pending: env vars (`NOTION_TOKEN`, `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, calendar IDs), cron trigger (`*/30 * * * *`), end-to-end test. Setup guide exists (`SETUP-GOOGLE-CALENDAR.md`). Test protocol written (`TEST-RUN.md`).

**Sales data project:**
- New Feb 22. Business intelligence for GPFC srl. Early stage.

## 5. TOOLS & STACK

| Tool | Role | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| Cursor | Primary coding IDE | Active — Cockpit rules now live (`cockpit-planning.mdc`, `mylifeos.mdc`) |
| Roo Code | AI coding harness (best architecture enforcer found so far) | Active — expensive, learning cost tiers |
| Claude Opus 4.6 | Architecture, complex decisions | Use selectively (€€€) |
| Claude Sonnet 4.6 | Implementation, straightforward tasks | Default workhorse |
| PRISM v1.3 | Morning intelligence briefing | Running nightly, 4 AM CET, 45+ RSS feeds |
| NightCrawler | Vault health bot | Running nightly, 3 AM CET |
| Now Page Bot v1.0 | Now-page automation | Pipeline functional, deploy pending |
| Obsidian + Git | Vault management | Auto-sync every 30 min to GitHub (raclettemeister/MyLifeOS) |
| Mac Mini 16GB | Only workstation | Primary machine |
| Cloudflare Workers | Backend for staffing system | Deployed, incomplete |
| Notion | Shop operations database | Live |
| ntfy (`mylifeos-business`) | Push notifications | Active |

## 6. LIFE

**Lucia:**
- Still at International Yehudi Menuhin Foundation. Quitting May 1, 2026 to go self-employed (art teaching + selling her work).
- New collaborative creative project started Feb 22: *All We Got Is Weeks* workshop.
- Julien needs to support her financially and with time as she makes this transition.
- Meeting anniversary: 27th of each month. Yearly anniversary: April 27.

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. No specific flags this week.

**Energy/cognitive load:**
- Launch day completed. High-output week (games shipped, Cockpit built, Now Page Bot debugged, infrastructure built). Likely some post-launch decompression coming.
- Julien has noted that multi-project vibe-coding creates cognitive debt; single-task creativity energizes. This week was heavy on the former.

**Upcoming relevance:**
- Lucia quitting May 1 is the next major life event with financial and relationship implications.
- No other imminent dates flagged in recent activity.
