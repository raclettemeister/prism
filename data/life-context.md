# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — Julien
**Generated: 2026-02-22 | For: PRISM Intelligence Briefing**

## 1. RIGHT NOW

Julien is in the immediate aftermath of a significant creative and operational push: Chez Julien Simulator shipped, Sweden Odyssey demo is done, and tomorrow (Feb 23) is the public launch of julien.care + The Dishwasher Generation Substack. The most consequential thing he did today wasn't shipping the game — it was designing The Cockpit (v0.1), a dev discipline system that he's designated his #1 priority across all coding work. He spent ~€60-70 on Roo Code/Opus 4.6 in a single session, got burned by the cost, and turned that pain into a structured framework. Energy reads as high-intensity but self-aware — a founder catching a bad pattern and building the fix.

## 2. THIS WEEK — ACTIVE PROJECTS

**The Cockpit (TOP PRIORITY — brand new, Feb 22)**
- v0.1 complete: SPEC.md written, STATUS.md created, first checklist (Daily Coding Session Ritual, 9 steps across PRE-FLIGHT/FLIGHT/POST-FLIGHT), Three Laws defined (no code without architecture / no moving forward without iteration / no "done" without review)
- Roadmap: v0.1 = manual markdown checklists → v0.3 = AI enforcement in Roo Code/Cursor rules → v1.0 = full enforcement
- Immediate need: resources on AI-assisted dev workflows, orchestration frameworks, Cursor/Roo Code best practices (≤1 month old), cost optimization (Opus vs Sonnet decision framework)
- Next real test: second game (Ren'Py or more advanced) — first project built under Cockpit discipline from day one

**julien.care / Feb 23 Launch (SHIPS TONIGHT)**
- julien.care text getting final polish
- Chez Julien Simulator: finished and confirmed shipped
- Sweden Odyssey: demo finished and playable
- The Dishwasher Generation (Substack): shipping for launch
- Launch is tomorrow — these need to close tonight

**Now Page Bot (v1.0 functional, v1.1 pending)**
- End-to-end pipeline works as of Feb 21 (run #8, 17 seconds): vault clone → freshness check → formatting → deploy → commit memory
- 7 formatting issues documented in SPEC.md with 3-phase fix plan
- Phase 1 (format.js fixes, resolves 5/7 issues) ready to execute
- Blocked by decision: deploy after Feb 23 launch
- NOT being touched this week

**Sales Data / Chez Julien BI (just started, Feb 22)**
- New project: data gathering and extrapolation of shop sales on business computer
- Business intelligence for GPFC srl
- Early stage, no further detail

**PRISM v2.0 (spec complete, not yet built)**
- Spec ready (Feb 18): multi-pass Haiku+Sonnet, 50 articles, ~€2.50/night budget
- Waiting for autonomous build session via fresh Cowork + Sonnet 4.6
- Not this week

## 3. PRIORITIES & STRUGGLES

**What matters most (his words):**
- The Cockpit is #1. Without it, every other project suffers. The shift: from "talk to AI and hope for the best" → "orchestrate AI with discipline and structure"
- Standing PRISM deep-dive request: surface anything on AI-assisted dev workflows, non-engineer software discipline, Cursor/Roo Code/orchestration best practices, AI cost optimization for founders — all ≤1 month old

**What's hard:**
- He vibes. Gives AI tasks that are too big, stays in stale conversations, skips architecture, skips iteration, skips review. The Cockpit is the direct response to this self-identified failure mode.
- Cost discipline: Opus 4.6 for everything = €60-70/day. Learning when expensive models are worth it (architecture, complex decisions) vs. when Sonnet suffices (implementation, routine tasks). This is now a Cockpit dimension.
- Low orderliness is a known self-identified weakness that undermines systems if unmanaged — The Cockpit is in part an orderliness prosthetic

**What he's not touching this week:**
- Staffing Calendar System (live but not viable — parked)
- Letta AI Agents (built Feb 15, unused since)
- PRISM v2.0 build
- Now Page Bot v1.1 (post-launch)

## 4. BUSINESS — CHEZ JULIEN / OPERATION AUTONOMY

**Strategic direction:** Operation Autonomy — push shop to full autonomy, Julien stays CEO with minimal time input. Old plan (sell = Operation Exit) is archived.

**Team status:**
- Henry (24, full-time, 4 months in): identified as the one to develop. Goal = manager-level within 6-month window. More motivated, growing fast, wants responsibility. Currently blocked from cognitive tasks because Lucas grabs them.
- Lucas (24, 3/4 time, 2 years): deliberately conserves cognitive energy for his own projects (creative agency, sound engineering). Best fit = customer-facing, high-intensity, low-cognitive work. Not being developed at the shop — offered stability + future collaboration as retention sugar.
- Big Meeting (Feb 14, past): full role restructure conversation — Henry gets development pitch + 5 paths, Lucas gets "let your best friend shine" frame + bonus numbers (4.5% for Lucas, 2% for Henry of sale price).

**Active shop infrastructure:**
- Staffing Calendar System: live (deployed Feb 17) but not viable yet — Pointage DB sharing issue, planning UX incomplete, mobile limited. Parked this week.
- Sales Data project: just started (Feb 22) — BI on business computer

**Henry development:** Monthly meeting cadence established. Feb 4 = foundation-laying. Big Meeting = role restructure. March = next formal meeting.

## 5. TOOLS & STACK

**Primary machine:** Mac Mini (16GB RAM) — only workstation. Runs Cursor + Claude Cowork.

**AI coding tools:**
- Roo Code: current preferred harness — forces architecture before code. Cost: Opus 4.6 = expensive (€60-70/day at full throttle). Sonnet = ~1/3 the cost.
- Cursor: also in use
- Model decision framework being built into The Cockpit: Opus for architecture/complex decisions, Sonnet for implementation/routine tasks

**Automation infrastructure:**
- PRISM v1.3: runs nightly 4 AM CET via GitHub Actions (raclettemeister/prism). 45+ RSS feeds, top 15 read in full, synthesized briefing + email. Reads Journal/context-note.md for deep dive requests.
- NightCrawler: runs 3 AM CET via GitHub Actions (raclettemeister/nightcrawler). Vault health bot — stale STATUS.md, CURRENT.md drift, naming issues. HTML report + ntfy notification.
- Now Page Bot: raclettemeister/now-page-bot. Sunday 11 PM CET (deploy) + Saturday 10 AM CET (reminder). v1.0 functional.
- Staffing Worker: Cloudflare Worker (chez-julien-staffing.old-morning-a434.workers.dev) — parked

**Vault:** MylifeOS on GitHub (raclettemeister/MyLifeOS, private). Obsidian Git auto-sync every 30 minutes. Moved off iCloud Feb 14.

**Notifications:** ntfy (topics: mylifeos-business)

## 6. LIFE

**Lucia:** Quitting her job May 1, 2026 to go self-employed (teaching art, selling art). Julien committed to supporting her with time and money during this transition. They have shared business ideas. Reynolds Mode enforced on evenings (work forbidden, full presence).

**Upcoming critical date:** Feb 23 tomorrow = public launch. This is the end of the stealth phase.

**Physical projects (emerging interest):** Furniture building, new leash design for Poncho. Exploring AI for physical product design — early curiosity, not active.

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. Active in daily life.

**Energy read:** High-output day (Feb 22) — shipped a game, finished a demo, built a whole discipline framework, logged everything properly. Signs of self-awareness increasing: catching bad patterns (vibecodng, cost overruns) and building structural responses rather than just resolving to do better. This is a behavioral shift worth noting.
