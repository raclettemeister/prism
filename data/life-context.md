# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — PRISM
**Generated:** 2026-02-28 | **For:** AI Intelligence Briefing

## 1. RIGHT NOW

Julien is in a state of self-diagnosed obsession — his own word. He knows he's out of balance, knows he's missing life, and hasn't yet resolved what to do about it. Today was a heavy system-building day: Mac Mini → MacBook Pro migration scripts, documentation standards, a game project setup plan. He's layering complexity and delegating execution to AI — this is the mode he's in, and he's questioning whether it's the right one.

## 2. THIS WEEK — ACTIVE PROJECTS

**System / Infrastructure (HOT — most activity this week)**
- Mac migration: designed the migration script architecture, wrote implementation plan, added MANUAL-STEPS.md and TROUBLESHOOTING.md, updated README.md. This is a real hardware transition, not a hobby project.
- Documentation standard: updated today. He's codifying how the system works, not just using it.
- NightCrawler (automated vault logging): running daily, generating reports. Infrastructure is live.

**Game Project (NEW — appeared today)**
- `Projects/Game Project/SETUP PLAN.md` created today. No prior activity in the log. This is fresh — possibly an impulsive start, possibly a deliberate new direction. Unknown scope.

**Blog Pipeline (ACTIVE — files modified this week)**
- 5-skill pipeline is fully built and documented: brainstorm → extract → draft → review → publish.
- Substack publish automation (blog-5) is live with Python script and cookie auth.
- Two platforms: `julien.care` (personal, friend energy) and `The Dishwasher Generation` (builder/Substack).
- No evidence of a post actually being written this week — the pipeline exists, content production unclear.

**System Coherence (COMPLETED this week)**
- Feb 26: full audit of LOG.md, CURRENT.md, NOW.md, Projects/README.md, Business/README.md, all STATUS files. Found everything stale (3-day gap, NOW.md 8 days behind, statuses frozen at Feb 22). Fixed. System is now current.

**Dancing / Guitar / Creative (PARKED this week)**
- Skills exist (dancing-session, guitar-coach). No log activity this week. Not the focus.

## 3. PRIORITIES & STRUGGLES

**What he said (his words, exact):**
> "It's all about leverage, layers of complexity, handling more complex, giving AI more work."
> "I'm not balanced enough. I'm obsessed. That's not good."
> "While I'm obsessed I'm missing out on life."
> "So what's the plan?"

**What this means:**
- He's in deep builder mode — the Mac migration, the game project, the documentation standards, the blog pipeline. All of this is systems work and infrastructure. It energizes him. It also consumes him.
- He knows the obsession is a problem. He's not in denial. But he doesn't yet have a plan to correct it.
- The 50/50 rule (half life, half investment) is almost certainly violated this week. Investment is dominating.
- The "what's the plan?" is an open question — he's asking it of himself, not answering it. This is the live tension as of Feb 28.

**Patterns to flag:**
- His own CLAUDE.md flags this: "I tend to overinvest in creative projects (Tier 1) while undertending life and relationships." This week confirms the pattern.
- He also notes: "I sometimes avoid simple human conversations by building automated systems instead." The Mac migration and documentation work could be a form of this.
- The game project appearing today — new project started while already imbalanced — fits his known founder pattern: build the machine, not operate it, and start new machines before old ones are running.

**What he's avoiding (inferred):**
- The Value Plan review / weekly reflection (no evidence it happened this week).
- Life — Lucia, Poncho, presence. No mention in the log.
- The business operational work (see below).

## 4. BUSINESS — CHEZ JULIEN / OPERATION AUTONOMY

**Status: Strategically clear, operationally quiet this week.**

- Operation Autonomy is the frame: make Chez Julien run without Julien. Henry → manager track. Lucas → sales focus. More student staff for simple tasks.
- The Feb 4 team meeting happened. Julien told them about Lucia quitting in May, framed it as an exciting transition, soft-pitched Henry on the manager path, asked Lucas for sales focus. The "big meeting" (Option 2 — full role restructure) is scheduled for March 2026.
- **This week: zero business activity in the log.** No meeting notes, no STATUS updates, no Operation Autonomy work. Business/STATUS.md freshness is unknown but likely stale given the Feb 26 coherence audit found everything stale.
- Henry: doing well, invested, 24 years old, lacks structure, needs training. Key person for autonomy.
- Lucas: questionable, good with customers, tendency to grab cognitive tasks he shouldn't.
- Lucia quitting May 1 is the hard deadline shaping everything — Julien needs the shop more autonomous by then, and needs bandwidth to support her transition.

**Recommendation for briefing:** Flag that the March "big meeting" is approaching and no visible prep work is in the log this week.

## 5. TOOLS & STACK

**Hardware (in transition):**
- Mac Mini → MacBook Pro migration is the current hardware project. Scripts being written. Not yet complete.

**AI / Software:**
- PRISM: automated morning intelligence briefing (this system).
- NightCrawler: automated nightly vault logging. Running daily (confirmed by 05:41 log entry today).
- Cursor: primary IDE for vault/code work. Skills system (.cursor/skills/) is active and expanding.
- Substack Python automation: live for The Dishwasher Generation publishing.
- MyLifeOS: Obsidian-style markdown vault. The operating system for his life.

**Models / Platforms:**
- Not specified in recent files. PRISM and Cursor are the primary AI surfaces.

## 6. LIFE

**Lucia:**
- Quitting her job May 1, 2026 to go self-employed (art teaching + selling). This is 61 days away.
- Julien needs to support her financially and with his presence. Currently, the obsession mode is pulling in the opposite direction of presence.
- Meeting anniversary: 27th of each month (next: March 27).

**Poncho:**
- Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. No mentions in this week's log. Likely being walked but not a focus.

**Energy / health:**
- No explicit data this week. The obsession self-diagnosis suggests high cognitive load, possibly low restorative activity (no dancing, no guitar sessions logged).
- His own system: when tired, use the Restorative Menu, not screens. No evidence this is happening.

**Key upcoming pressure:**
- March 2026: "The Big Meeting" with Henry and Lucas — full role restructure conversation.
- May 1, 2026: Lucia quits. Hard deadline for financial and presence bandwidth.

## SIGNAL FOR BRIEFING AI

Julien is in a high-output, low-balance week. He's building well (migration, documentation, game project, pipeline). He knows it. The live question he's holding is: *what's the plan to correct the imbalance?* The briefing should not flatter the productivity — it should surface the tension he named and help him think about the plan he's asking for. He's 31, obsession-prone, excellent at building machines, poor at operating in steady-state. The correction isn't to stop building — it's to build the life structure with the same rigor he brings to the tech stack.
