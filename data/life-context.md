# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — Julien
**Generated:** 2026-02-22 | **For:** PRISM Intelligence Briefing

## 1. RIGHT NOW

Julien is in the final hours before his **Feb 23 public launch** (julien.care + games + Substack), but his dominant mental energy today was consumed by a more fundamental shift: **The Cockpit**, a dev discipline system he designed and documented from scratch on Feb 22. This is not a distraction from the launch — he's reframing it as the meta-infrastructure that determines whether every future project ships cleanly. He also spent ~€60-70 on Claude Opus 4.6 via Roo Code in a single day, which triggered real cost-awareness as a new discipline layer.

## 2. THIS WEEK — ACTIVE PROJECTS

**🔴 TOP PRIORITY: The Cockpit (v0.1 — built Feb 22)**
- Dev discipline system to stop vibecodng. Metaphor: helicopter pre-flight checklist before any coding session.
- Three Laws: no code without architecture / no forward movement without iteration / no "done" without review.
- First checklist: Daily Coding Session Ritual (9 steps: PRE-FLIGHT / FLIGHT / POST-FLIGHT).
- Files created: `SPEC.md`, `STATUS.md`, `Checklists/01-daily-session.md`.
- Roadmap: v0.1 (manual checklists) → v0.3 (AI enforcement in Roo Code/Cursor rules) → v1.0 (full enforcement).
- **Standing PRISM request:** Surface anything on AI-assisted dev workflows, orchestration frameworks, Cursor/Roo Code best practices, software discipline for non-engineers, model cost optimization. Max 1 month old.

**🟡 Feb 23 Launch — ships tonight**
- **Chez Julien Simulator**: FINISHED and shipped (confirmed Feb 22).
- **Sweden Odyssey demo**: Finished and playable. First real test of "learning to code properly, not vibing." Collaborative project with friends.
- **julien.care**: Text/voice getting final polish. Launch tomorrow.
- **The Dishwasher Generation** (Substack): Part of the Feb 23 launch package.

**🟡 Now Page Bot (v1.0 — functional as of Feb 21, Run #8)**
- Full pipeline works: vault clone → freshness check → formatting → deploy → commit memory. 17 seconds.
- 7 formatting issues identified and documented in SPEC.md (raw markdown renders as text, preamble leaks, no French translation, bullet cramming, manual Vercel deploy required, raw `#` in section titles, duplicate header).
- Phase 1 fix (format.js — resolves 5/7 problems) is ready to execute.
- **Holding**: Deploy after Feb 23 launch. Don't touch this week.

**🟢 Julien & Lucia — New project folder (created Feb 22)**
- `Projects/Julien & Lucia/` set up as base for collaborative creative work with Lucia.
- First project inside: **All We Got Is Weeks** — workshop where participants visualize their life as ~4,160 weeks on a grid, paint their past in watercolors, decide what to color next.
- Concept captured in STATUS.md. Early stage.

**🟢 Sales Data — Chez Julien (new, Feb 22)**
- Data gathering and extrapolation of shop sales on the business computer.
- Business intelligence for GPFC srl. Just started.

**⚪ PRISM v2.0**
- Spec complete (Feb 18). Multi-pass Haiku+Sonnet, 50 articles, ~€2.50/night budget.
- Ready to build autonomously via fresh Cowork session. Not started yet.

**⚪ Second game (Ren'Py or more advanced)**
- Coming after Feb 23 launch. Will be **the first real Cockpit test** — full structure and discipline from day one. Not yet started.

## 3. PRIORITIES & STRUGGLES

**What matters most (his own words):**
1. **The Cockpit** — everything else suffers without it. This is the foundational shift.
2. **Feb 23 launch** — ships tonight regardless.
3. **Becoming an operator, not a hobbyist** — orchestrating AI with discipline vs. hoping for the best.

**What's hard:**
- **Vibecodng pattern**: gives Cursor/Claude tasks too big, stays in stale conversations, skips architecture and iteration, moves too fast. The Cockpit is the direct counter.
- **Cost awareness gap**: spent €60-70 in one day on Opus 4.6. Now needs a mental model for Opus (architecture, complex decisions) vs. Sonnet (implementation, straightforward tasks).
- **Cognitive debt**: multi-project vibe-coding burns him out. Single-task creative work energizes him. Session discipline is partly an energy management issue.

**Standing deep dives for PRISM:**
- AI-assisted dev workflows and orchestration frameworks (≤1 month old)
- Cursor / Roo Code best practices
- Software architecture discipline for non-engineers
- AI model cost optimization for founders
- Proper multi-pass review / iteration before accepting AI output

**What's parked / not touching:**
- Staffing Calendar System (live but not viable — not touching this week)
- Letta AI Agents (built Feb 15, unused since)
- NightCrawler (deployed, operational, no action needed)

## 4. BUSINESS — CHEZ JULIEN

**Operation Autonomy** is the active frame (replaced Operation Exit — decided not to sell).
- Goal: shop runs without Julien's daily presence. Henry develops into manager-level. Software handles heavy lifting.
- **Henry**: Full-time, 4 months in, growing fast, genuinely motivated. The key investment. Still lacks maturity for full manager role but on trajectory.
- **Lucas**: Part-time (3/4), 2 years in, strategically disengaged from cognitive work. Good on customers. Not being developed — matched to what he'll actually give.
- **Staffing Calendar System**: Cloudflare Worker + HTML dashboard + Notion + Google Calendar integration. Deployed Feb 17, technically live but not production-ready. Env vars and cron trigger still pending. Not being touched this week.
- **Sales Data project**: Just started (Feb 22) — extracting and extrapolating shop sales data for business intelligence.
- **Big Meeting** (Feb 14): Already happened — Henry given manager development pitch, Lucas given "let your best friend shine" frame + bonus structure (Lucas 4.5%, Henry 2% of sale price).

## 5. TOOLS & STACK

| Tool | Role | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| **Roo Code** | Primary AI coding harness | Active — best found so far, forces architecture before code |
| **Cursor** | AI code editor | Active |
| **Claude Opus 4.6** | Complex architecture decisions | Used today — expensive (€60-70/day at max use) |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.6** | Implementation, straightforward tasks | Should use more — ~3x cheaper than Opus |
| **Mac Mini (16GB)** | Only workstation | Primary machine |
| **MylifeOS** | Obsidian vault on GitHub (private) | Auto-syncs every 30 min via Obsidian Git |
| **PRISM** | Morning intelligence briefing | Running nightly 4 AM CET via GitHub Actions |
| **NightCrawler** | Vault health bot | Running 3 AM CET, catching issues |
| **Now Page Bot** | julien.care/now updater | Functional v1.0, holding deploy until post-launch |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automation backbone | 3 active repos: prism, nightcrawler, now-page-bot |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Staffing system backend | Live but incomplete |
| **Notion** | Shop operations (Disponibilités, Congés, Pointage) | Active |
| **ntfy** | Push notifications | Topic: `mylifeos-business` |

**Model cost discipline (new as of Feb 22):** Opus for architecture and complex decisions. Sonnet for implementation. This is now a Cockpit rule.

## 6. LIFE

**Lucia:**
- Artist, currently at International Yehudi Menuhin Foundation (MUS-E). Quitting May 1, 2026 → going self-employed (teaching art, selling her art).
- Julien is financially and temporally supporting her transition.
- **New creative collaboration**: `Projects/Julien & Lucia/` launched Feb 22. First project: All We Got Is Weeks workshop.
- Monthly anniversary: 27th of each month.

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. Ongoing.

**Energy/mood signal:** Today was a high-output, high-cost day. The €60-70 spend suggests deep focus but also possibly uncontrolled scope. The Cockpit creation feels like a response to a felt crisis — "this has to stop" language in his own words. Launch pressure is real but he appears to be shipping.

**Upcoming hard date:** Feb 23 — public launch. Everything converges tomorrow.
