# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — PRISM
**Generated:** 2026-03-01 | **Next review:** 2026-03-08

## 1. RIGHT NOW

Julien is in an intentional exploration phase — not optimizing existing projects, but scanning for what deserves serious commitment starting in ~6 months. His own words are explicit: current games and projects are not the point. The point is understanding the landscape, staying at the edge, and identifying what's worth pursuing. He has no answer yet — that's the design. He's running many parallel experiments to find signal.

## 2. THIS WEEK

**Active / Moving:**

- **Mac Mini → MacBook Pro migration** — concrete work done Feb 28: design doc, implementation plan, MANUAL-STEPS.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, README.md update. This is infrastructure work, not a project — clearing technical debt to free up cognitive space.
- **Blog pipeline** — four skills built and apparently complete (brainstorm → extract → draft → review → publish to Substack). The pipeline is sophisticated and production-ready. Suggests writing is either active or about to be activated. Platforms: julien.care (personal, friend-energy) and The Dishwasher Generation (builder/maker Substack).
- **Game Project** — SETUP PLAN.md added Feb 28. A game is in early setup. Julien's own framing: this is not what matters long-term, but it's what he's doing today.
- **System coherence** — Feb 26: full audit of LOG.md, CURRENT.md, NOW.md, Projects/README.md, Business/README.md. Found stale statuses everywhere (8+ days behind). Fixed. Signals Julien is in a "reset and clean house" mode, not just building.
- **Cursor skills system** — Multiple active skills: guitar coach, dancing session, blog pipeline (5 skills), business status update, value plan review, weekly business plan. The skill infrastructure is mature and being actively used/refined.

**Parked / Background:**
- Dancing practice (Lindy Hop) — skill exists and is detailed, but no session logged in visible activity. Present as infrastructure.
- Guitar practice — skill exists, no recent session logged.

## 3. PRIORITIES & STRUGGLES

**What Julien said matters most (his words, highest trust):**
- Not any current project specifically — the *meta-question* of what to pursue seriously.
- Staying at the edge of what's happening (AI, tools, ideas).
- Understanding what's worth pursuing vs. not — this is the active cognitive work.
- He explicitly doesn't know the answer. The exploration *is* the strategy right now.

**What's hard:**
- Operating in a fog of intentional uncertainty — many projects, no single north star yet. This is chosen, not accidental, but it creates diffuse energy.
- Low orderliness (self-identified weakness) — the Feb 26 system audit revealed multiple stale files and gaps. He caught it and fixed it, but the pattern recurs.
- The shop (Chez Julien) still has operational pull. It's not fully autonomous yet — Henry is developing but not there. This competes with the exploration phase.

**What he's avoiding (inferred, not stated):**
- Committing prematurely to any single direction before the 6-month horizon.
- The operational grind of the shop (by design — Operation Autonomy is the answer to this).

## 4. BUSINESS — CHEZ JULIEN

**Operation Autonomy** — active strategic frame since February 2026. Goal: shop runs without Julien's daily involvement. Previous plan (Operation Exit / sell) was archived.

**Team status (from files, cross-checked against meeting notes):**
- **Henry** — full-time, invested, doing well. Target: autonomous manager. Current gap: 24 years old, lacks experience and structure, not yet reliable enough. Monthly meetings started Feb 4. Henry is being pitched the manager path ("soft training" — door is open, not forced).
- **Lucas** — part-time/quasi-full-time, "questionable." Strong with customers, tends to grab cognitive tasks that should go to Henry. The Feb 4 meeting gave Lucas a clear frame: sales focus, fair deal, future opportunity.
- **Next big meeting: March 2026** — "The Big Meeting" — full role restructure conversation. This is imminent (this month). Agenda: Option 2, full conversation about roles, Henry/Lucas division, development paths.

**Financial context:** ~500K annual sales, high profitability. 48% building ownership (18-year loan). Monthly admin checklist open (Fiddel closure, budget review, Liantis hours, strategic plan review).

**What needs attention this week:** The Big Meeting with Henry and Lucas is scheduled for March 2026 — likely this month. Preparation files exist (README.md, PREP.md). This is a real near-term deliverable.

## 5. TOOLS & STACK

**Primary environment:** MacBook Pro (migration from Mac Mini just completed or in progress — setup plan added Feb 28).

**AI/Dev environment:** Cursor IDE with a custom skills system (.cursor/skills/). Skills are markdown-defined agent behaviors. This is Julien's primary AI interaction layer — not chat interfaces, but structured task execution within his vault.

**Vault:** MyLifeOS — Obsidian-style markdown system. NightCrawler (automated agent) handles nightly file updates, context notes, and daily log entries. The system is sophisticated: LOG.md, CURRENT.md, NOW.md, STATUS.md files per project, Journal/Daily/, Journal/Weekly/.

**Publishing:** Substack (The Dishwasher Generation) — Python-based publish script with cookie auth. Post pipeline: brainstorm → extract → draft → review → final.md → push.

**PRISM:** Automated morning intelligence briefing (this system). Julien follows AI developments via Substack and Readwise feeds — not LLM-generated summaries of the field, but live feeds.

**Models in use:** Not specified in recent files. Cursor implies Claude or GPT-4-class models for skill execution.

## 6. LIFE

**Lucia:** Artist, currently at the International Yehudi Menuhin Foundation. **Quitting May 1, 2026** to go self-employed (art teaching + her own art). This is a major life transition in ~2 months. Julien needs to support her financially and with his time. They have business ideas together. The May transition is a real near-term forcing function.

**Key upcoming dates:**
- **March 2026** — The Big Meeting (Henry/Lucas role restructure). Imminent.
- **May 1, 2026** — Lucia quits her job. Life changes significantly.
- **~September 2026** — Julien's self-stated horizon for starting to pursue his next thing seriously.
- Monthly anniversary: March 27 (meeting anniversary with Lucia).

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. Active presence in daily life.

**Energy/health (inferred):** No explicit health flags in recent activity. System audit + migration work suggests a "reset" energy — clearing clutter, building clean foundations. Not crisis mode. Active infrastructure-building phase.

**50/50 balance:** Target is half life (presence, health, relationships), half investment (career, AI, projects). No explicit flag this week that it's off, but the exploration phase + shop demands + Lucia transition all create pressure on the life side.

## SIGNAL FOR AI ANALYST

Julien is **not optimizing** — he is **scanning**. The correct frame for any intelligence briefing is: *what is worth knowing about at the frontier?* Not productivity tips. Not how to run his shop better. He wants to understand what's happening in AI, tools, ideas, and the world so that when he commits in 6 months, he commits to the right thing. Feed him edge signals, not mainstream summaries. He already knows the mainstream.
