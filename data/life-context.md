# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — Julien
**Generated:** 2026-02-22 | **For:** PRISM Intelligence Briefing

## 1. RIGHT NOW

Julien is in the immediate aftermath of his Feb 23 public launch — Chez Julien Simulator shipped, Sweden Odyssey demo finished, julien.care text getting final polish tonight. Simultaneously, a higher-order priority crystallized today: **The Cockpit**, a dev discipline system he built v0.1 of this afternoon, which he considers the meta-infrastructure that makes all future coding work viable. He's energized but aware he burned ~€60-70 on Claude Opus 4.6 today through Roo Code — a cost he's turning into a learning signal rather than a failure.

---

## 2. THIS WEEK — ACTIVE PROJECTS

**The Cockpit (TOP PRIORITY — started today, Feb 22)**
- v0.1 built and documented: SPEC.md, STATUS.md, first checklist (Daily Coding Session Ritual — 9 steps across PRE-FLIGHT / FLIGHT / POST-FLIGHT), Three Laws (no code without architecture / no forward without iteration / no "done" without review)
- Roadmap: v0.1 = manual markdown checklists → v0.3 = AI enforcement in Roo Code/Cursor rules → v1.0 = full enforcement
- Standing request to PRISM: surface AI-assisted dev workflow resources, orchestration frameworks, Cursor/Roo Code best practices, cost optimization guides (max 1 month old)

**Feb 23 Launch (shipping today/tonight)**
- Chez Julien Simulator: ✅ DONE, shipped
- Sweden Odyssey demo: ✅ DONE, playable
- julien.care text/voice: final polish in progress
- Everything goes public tomorrow

**Now Page Bot (paused until after launch)**
- v1.0 pipeline functional as of Feb 21 (run #8, 17 seconds end-to-end)
- 7 formatting issues documented in SPEC.md with 3-phase fix plan
- Phase 1 (format.js — fixes 5 of 7 issues) ready to execute post-launch
- Deploy target: after Feb 23

**Julien & Lucia — "All We Got Is Weeks" (new, Feb 22)**
- New collaborative project folder created: `Projects/Julien & Lucia/`
- First project: workshop where participants visualize life as ~4,160 weeks on a grid, paint their past with watercolors, decide what to color next
- Early concept stage, STATUS.md captured

**Second Game (upcoming)**
- Renpy or more advanced engine
- Will be the first real Cockpit test in action — proper architecture and SPEC from day one before any code

**Sales Data / Chez Julien BI (new, Feb 22)**
- Started data gathering and extrapolation of shop sales on business computer
- Business intelligence for GPFC srl — early stage

## 3. PRIORITIES & STRUGGLES

**What matters most (Julien's own words):**
- The Cockpit is #1 across all coding work. Without it, every project produces messes.
- The shift: from "talk to AI and hope" → "orchestrate AI with discipline and structure"
- Every session follows the checklist. Every project starts with a SPEC. Every plan iterates 4-5x before execution.

**Core struggle being addressed:**
- Vibecoding: tasks too big, stale conversations, skipping architecture, skipping iteration, skipping review
- Moving too fast because AI enables it — producing messes as a result
- Cost blindness: €60-70 in one day on Opus 4.6 when Sonnet would have sufficed for implementation tasks

**New dimension of discipline — cost-efficiency:**
- Opus worth it for: architecture decisions, complex reasoning
- Sonnet sufficient for: implementation, straightforward tasks
- This is now a Cockpit concern, not just a budget concern

**Standing deep dive request to PRISM:**
- AI-assisted dev workflows and orchestration frameworks
- Cursor / Roo Code best practices
- Software discipline for non-technical founders
- AI cost optimization strategies
- Resources must be ≤1 month old

**What he's NOT touching this week:**
- Staffing Calendar System (live but not viable — parked)
- Letta AI agents (built Feb 15, unused since)
- PRISM v2.0 (spec complete, not yet built)
- Staffing/team management system (parked)

## 4. BUSINESS — CHEZ JULIEN / OPERATION AUTONOMY

**Current direction:** Operation Autonomy — make the shop run without Julien's daily presence. Henry is the key investment.

**Henry:** Full-time, 4 months in (since Oct 2025), age 24. Growing fast. Target: manager-level within the autonomy timeline. The Feb 14 "Big Meeting" has passed (content in files suggests it was prepped and likely held) — outcomes not logged yet in the snapshot data.

**Lucas:** Part-time (3/4), 2 years in, age 24. Good with customers, strategically disengaged from cognitive shop work. Management approach: customer-facing tasks only, no project/thinking work.

**Staffing Calendar System:** Deployed Feb 17, Cloudflare Worker + Notion + Google Calendar integration. Julien's absences auto-sync via calendar. Red day flagging (🟡/🔴/🔴🔴) operational. Known issues remain — not being touched this week.

**Sales data project:** New BI effort started Feb 22 — gathering and extrapolating sales data from business computer. Early stage.

## 5. TOOLS & STACK

| Tool | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Roo Code** | Primary coding harness | Forces architecture before code — best harness found so far |
| **Cursor** | Active | Used alongside Roo Code |
| **Claude Opus 4.6** | Used today — expensive | ~€60-70 in one day; learning when to deploy vs Sonnet |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.5/4.6** | Preferred for implementation | ~1/3 the cost of Opus |
| **Mac Mini (16GB)** | Only workstation | Runs Cursor + Claude Cowork |
| **PRISM** | Running nightly at 4 AM CET | v1.3, 45+ feeds, emails morning briefing; v2.0 spec ready but not built |
| **NightCrawler** | Deployed, operational | Runs 3 AM CET, vault health scans, ntfy alerts |
| **Now Page Bot** | Functional, pre-deploy | Pipeline working, 7 fixes pending, deploy after Feb 23 |
| **Obsidian + GitHub** | Vault sync | Auto-syncs every 30 min via Obsidian Git plugin |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Shop staffing infra | Staffing calendar worker live at `chez-julien-staffing.old-morning-a434.workers.dev` |

**Key workflow principle:** Always open a new chat. Always read the SPEC. Iterate architecture 4-5x before coding. Implement in small pieces. Review before closing.

## 6. LIFE

**Lucia:**
- Artist, currently at International Yehudi Menuhin Foundation (MUS-E programme)
- Quitting May 1, 2026 → self-employed: teaching art + selling her own work
- Julien is financially and temporally supporting this transition
- New creative collaboration started: `Projects/Julien & Lucia/` — "All We Got Is Weeks" workshop is first joint project
- Meeting anniversary: 27th of each month

**Upcoming:**
- **Feb 23 (tomorrow):** Public launch — julien.care live, games published, Dishwasher Generation Substack
- **May 1, 2026:** Lucia leaves her job — significant life transition incoming

**Energy/patterns:**
- Single-task creativity (writing, designing) energizes him; multi-project vibe-coding creates cognitive debt
- Building The Cockpit is partly a response to burnout from unstructured AI coding sessions
- The €60-70 day was intensive but generative — he reframed it as "learning the right process, not optimizing cost"

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old (born June 2023). Physical product interest emerging: new leash design. AI-assisted physical design being explored alongside furniture building.

*Snapshot density: HIGH. Recency bias applied — projects untouched this week omitted. The Cockpit and the Feb 23 launch are the twin centers of gravity for this briefing window.*
