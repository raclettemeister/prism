# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — Julien
**Generated:** 2026-02-27

---

## 1. Right Now

Julien is in a post-build consolidation phase. A major sprint just landed: the full 5-skill blog pipeline (brainstorm → extract → draft → review → publish) is complete and operational in Cursor, including a working Substack publish script for The Dishwasher Generation. The Projects/ folder was reorganized into 7 categories. The Sale Intelligence suite (12 files, full valuation and prospect kit) is complete. Blog launch is delayed by a few days — he's noted it explicitly and is fine with it. Energy reads as calm and stable, not urgent.

## 2. This Week — Active Projects

**Blog Pipeline (Dishwasher Generation + julien.care)**
- All 5 skills built and live in `.cursor/skills/`: blog-1-brainstorm through blog-5-publish
- Substack publish script operational (`substack_publish.py`) with auth, create, push, and frontmatter write-back
- Blog launch delayed a few days — acknowledged, no stress
- Next step: actually run a post through the pipeline end-to-end

**Cockpit / AI Workflow**
- Settled on: **Cursor + Superpowers skill set + custom skills and rules**
- Known limitations: still implements things automatically sometimes; hard to request multiple passes on the same thinking
- Actively watching for a better cockpit — defines "cockpit" as the harness + environment + architecture + workflow (not just prompting an LLM)
- This framing is stable; not changing tools imminently

**Sale Intelligence Suite**
- Complete: 12 files, full valuation + prospect kit
- Julien is planning deep research to find prospects for selling the retail shop — focus on chains and centralized kitchens
- Already has a multi-cheese place owner interested
- Status: kit ready, prospecting research next

**RenPy Game**
- Postponed at least one week
- Julien is using the pause to think through what his cockpit for game creation will look like before starting
- Not dead — deliberately parked

**Physical Products / Making**
- Active interest: furniture building, new leash design for Poncho
- Exploring how AI can assist physical design and fabrication
- Thinking about 3D printers
- No concrete project started yet — ideation phase

**System Maintenance (2026-02-26)**
- Full coherence audit done: LOG.md, CURRENT.md, NOW.md, Projects/README.md, Business/README.md, all STATUS files
- Found stale entries across the board (statuses frozen at Feb 22, 3-day log gap, NOW.md 8 days behind)
- Fixed: stale project statuses, NOW.md updated, Business/README.md cleaned
- CURRENT.md queued for rewrite — not yet done

## 3. Priorities & Struggles

**What matters most right now:**
- Getting the blog actually launched (pipeline is built, delay is fine, but publishing is the real goal)
- Prospecting for the shop sale — deep research into chains and centralized kitchens
- Maintaining the cockpit: Cursor + custom skills is working, keep refining

**What's hard:**
- Cursor still auto-implements sometimes without being asked
- Difficult to get multiple passes on the same reasoning — single-pass LLM limitation he hasn't solved yet
- He's watching for a better cockpit but hasn't found one

**What's parked (intentionally):**
- RenPy game — one week minimum
- Physical products — ideation only

**What's NOT mentioned / likely backgrounded:**
- Guitar, dancing — skills exist in the vault but no recent session logged
- Operation Autonomy / Henry development — no recent activity in log

## 4. Business — Chez Julien

**Strategic direction:** Dual-track. Operation Autonomy is the official frame (build toward shop running without Julien). But the Sale Intelligence suite being complete and the prospect research planned signals the sell path is actively being explored in parallel — not archived.

**Sale prospecting:** Julien is preparing to do deep research for selling the shop. Target buyers: chains, centralized kitchens. One warm lead already exists (multi-cheese place owner). The prospect kit is ready.

**Team:** No team updates in the last 3-day log. Last substantive team context is the February 4 meeting (Henry soft-pitched on manager path; Lucas asked to focus on sales/floor). Henry development and the "Big Meeting" (originally March 2026) are presumably coming but not actively in focus this week.

**Operation Autonomy:** Structurally set up (folder exists, strategy documented) but no active work logged recently. The autonomy push and the sell prep are running in parallel — Julien has noted this is fine since the work is the same either way.

## 5. Tools & Stack

| Layer | What he's using |
|---|---|
| **Primary cockpit** | Cursor + Superpowers skill set + custom skills + custom rules |
| **Skills built** | blog-1 through blog-5, dancing-session, guitar-coach, update-business-status, value-plan-review, weekly-business-plan |
| **Publishing** | Substack (The Dishwasher Generation) via `substack_publish.py` |
| **Vault** | MyLifeOS — markdown files, local |
| **Automation** | NightCrawler (auto-logs context notes, nightly reports) |
| **Intelligence** | PRISM (morning AI briefing system) |
| **Known friction** | Auto-implementation, single-pass reasoning limits in Cursor |
| **Watching for** | Better cockpit — harness + environment + architecture + workflow |

## 6. Life

**Lucia:** Quitting her job May 1, 2026 to go self-employed (art teaching + selling her art). Julien is financially and emotionally supporting this transition. Today is the 27th — their monthly meeting anniversary.

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. New leash design is one of Julien's physical product interests.

**Energy/mood:** Reads as calm and grounded. Recent sprint (blog pipeline, project reorganization, Sale Intelligence suite) was a big day — now in a quieter phase. Blog delay noted without distress. No urgency signals in recent words.

**Upcoming relevant date:** Lucia's job transition — May 1, 2026. No immediate personal deadlines flagged.
