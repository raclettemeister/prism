# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — PRISM
**Generated:** 2026-03-02 | **Next update:** 2026-03-03

## 1. Right Now

Julien is in a deliberate holding pattern. March 2 started clean — no commits, no journal, no active moves. His own framing: the current projects and games he's developing are not the point. In 6 months, he will start doing something seriously. Right now is entirely about understanding — what's worth pursuing, what isn't. He has no answer yet, which is why he's running experiments across many fronts simultaneously. He describes himself as needing to be "at the edge."

## 2. This Week

**Active / Moving:**
- **Blog pipeline (Cursor skills)** — The most recently modified files are the full 5-skill blog pipeline: brainstorm → extract → draft → review → publish to Substack. This system is built and operational. Skills exist for julien.care and The Dishwasher Generation (Substack). The publish skill includes a working Python script for Substack API via cookie auth. This is infrastructure that's ready; writing output depends on Julien initiating a post.
- **Mac Mini → MacBook Pro migration** — Feb 28: design doc, implementation plan, MANUAL-STEPS.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, and README all added. Active setup work. Likely mid-migration or just completed.
- **Dancing (Lindy Hop)** — A full AI-coached practice session skill exists (`dancing-session`). STATUS.md and LOG.md are being maintained. This is a live daily practice with progression tracking.
- **Guitar** — `guitar-coach` skill is built. North star: humble country ballad songwriter/singer. Full coaching loop with LOG.md and PROGRESS.md. Status unclear from recent activity but the infrastructure is maintained.
- **Game project** — `Projects/Game Project/SETUP PLAN.md` added Feb 28. A game is in setup/planning phase. By Julien's own words, this is NOT the main focus — it's one of "dozens of projects" in the exploration phase.

**Infrastructure / System:**
- **NightCrawler** — Running nightly (auto-updates CURRENT.md and nightcrawler-report.md). Automated. No manual intervention needed.
- **Business status skills** — `update-business-status` and `weekly-business-plan` skills are built and operational. Suggest these haven't been run recently (no recent LOG activity on business planning).
- **Documentation Standard** — Updated Feb 28 (`System/Documentation Standard.md`). Signals ongoing system hygiene.

**Idle / Not touched this week:**
- julien.care blog posts (pipeline exists, no active draft visible)
- Chez Julien Simulator, Examine Your Life app, Lindy Hop Lab — no recent activity signals

## 3. Priorities & Struggles

**What actually matters (his words, highest trust):**
- Not the games. Not the current projects.
- **In 6 months, something serious begins.** Current period = reconnaissance, not execution.
- Mission: understand what's worth pursuing. Be at the edge of what's happening.
- He's trying many things *because* he doesn't know yet — this is intentional, not scattered.

**What's hard:**
- Operating without a north star project. The discomfort of not knowing is the point, but it's still uncomfortable.
- Low orderliness (self-identified weakness) risks letting the exploration phase become drift rather than deliberate scanning.
- Risk pattern: overinvesting in Tier 3 creative projects while underliving Tier 1 (presence, health, relationships).

**What he's not doing right now:**
- Not executing on any single focused project
- No journal entries visible in the last 48h (NightCrawler ran; Julien was quiet)
- Business operations appear to be running passively (no meetings logged, no weekly business plan activity this week)

## 4. Business — Chez Julien / Operation Autonomy

**Strategic context:**
- Goal: full shop autonomy so Julien can exit daily operations. Previously considered selling (Operation Exit, archived). Current path: build Henry into autonomous manager + build software tools to systematize the shop.
- Revenue: ~500K annual sales, high profitability. 48% building ownership (18-year loan).

**Team status (last confirmed, Feb 4 meeting):**
- **Henry** — Full-time, invested, wants a manager/operating officer role. 24 years old, lacks structure, not fully reliable yet. The Feb 4 meeting opened the soft manager pitch: "if you want it, the door is open." The Big Meeting (full role restructure) was planned for March 2026.
- **Lucas** — Part-time/full-time borderline, customer-facing strength, questionable engagement. The Feb 4 meeting framed a "fair deal": focus on sales while here, potential future collaboration.
- **The Big Meeting** — Was scheduled for March 2026 (next meeting after Feb 4). No activity visible in the last 3 days suggesting it has happened yet. This may be imminent.

**Operation Autonomy status:**
- Phase: Setup & Planning (started February 2026)
- Staffing Calendar System project exists (`Projects/Software/Staffing Calendar System/`)
- Folders 01_Strategy, 02_Henry_Development, 04_Processes, 06_Metrics flagged as expected but may not yet exist
- Monthly Admin checklist (Fiddel, Liantis, budget review) — March 1st trigger, status unknown

**This week's likely business action:** The Big Meeting with Henry and Lucas may be due in March. Monthly admin checklist triggered March 1.

## 5. Tools & Stack

- **Editor:** Cursor (all skills are `.cursor/skills/` — this is his primary AI-augmented environment)
- **AI workflow:** PRISM (morning intelligence briefing, automated), NightCrawler (nightly vault maintenance)
- **OS:** MacBook Pro (mid-migration from Mac Mini as of Feb 28)
- **Publishing:** Substack (The Dishwasher Generation) via Python script + cookie auth; julien.care (personal blog)
- **Vault:** MyLifeOS in Markdown — the operating system for his entire life and work
- **Models in use:** Not specified in recent files; CLAUDE.md indicates he follows AI closely via Substack + Readwise feeds
- **Other tools in stack:** Fiddel (shop invoicing/closure), Liantis (employee hours), Notion (live shop operations — separate from MyLifeOS vault), Serge (accountant, external)

## 6. Life

**Lucia:**
- Quitting her job May 1, 2026 to go self-employed (art teaching + selling her own work). This is a live, near-term financial and logistical commitment — Julien needs to support her with time and money.
- Monthly anniversary: 27th. April 27 = yearly anniversary.
- Joint creative/business projects on the horizon post-May.

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. Daily presence.

**Health/energy:** No journal entries or explicit signals in the last 48h. Quiet night on March 1. Energy state unknown but no distress signals.

**Key upcoming dates:**
- **May 1, 2026** — Lucia quits her job. Major life transition incoming.
- **March 2026** — The Big Meeting with Henry and Lucas (role restructure). Possibly this week.
- **March 1** — Monthly admin checklist triggered (Fiddel, Liantis, budget review).

**Dancing:** Daily Lindy Hop practice is a keystone habit (community fuel, Tier 1). The `dancing-session` skill is built and maintained — signals this is active.

*Snapshot confidence: HIGH on identity and strategic framing (Julien's own words). MEDIUM on business team status (last confirmed Feb 4). LOW on current energy/mood (quiet night, no journal). Treat the 6-month horizon framing as the load-bearing context for all briefing personalization.*
