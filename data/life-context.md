# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — Julien

## RIGHT NOW

Julien is in recovery/polish mode after a high-intensity build week. Monday Feb 17 he completed the Substack business infrastructure (3 interconnected posts + vision skeleton) and is pushing toward 1,000 paid subscribers as the objective. Both blogs (personal julien.care + The Dishwasher Generation Substack) launch publicly Feb 23. His single task this week: full pass on personal blog text — no infrastructure, no features, just the words. He's also doing a thinking pass on "why 2 blogs, what are they for, and why different?"

## THIS WEEK (Feb 17-23)

**Active projects:**

- **Personal blog (julien.care)** — LIVE, needs text polish before Feb 23 public launch. Infrastructure complete.
- **The Dishwasher Generation (Substack)** — Skeleton built Monday with 3 interconnected posts. Goal: 1,000 paid subscribers ASAP.
- **PRISM (night assistant)** — Needs to scale from 90k tokens to 900k tokens (10x improvement). Key challenge: "the most important thing will be to FIND what to ask of it."
- **First game** — Clean finish for publication Sunday (Feb 23). Nearly complete.
- **Physical product exploration (NEW)** — Interested in furniture and physical products (has a new leash design idea for Poncho). Will explore how AI can help design and build physical things.

**Explicitly NOT this week:**
- Letta sync
- New tools or agent frameworks
- Dashboard tinkering
- "Revolutionary github repos"

**Key insight driving him:** "Start being public, start being a voice on internet now, you got interested things to say. Time on the web beats timing the web."

## PRIORITIES & STRUGGLES

**Current priorities (from his own words):**

1. Full text pass on personal blog (only task before Feb 23 launch)
2. Conceptual clarity: why 2 blogs, what's each for?
3. PRISM token expansion (90k → 900k) — main blocker is figuring out what to ask it
4. Game publication (Sunday deadline)
5. Starting to be a public voice online

**What he's avoiding this week:**
- Infrastructure work (explicitly forbidden)
- New shiny tools
- Dashboard or system tinkering
- Letta integration work

**The pattern:**
Recent activity log (Feb 15-16) shows he crashed hard into infrastructure work (Staffing Calendar System — 3 consecutive sessions, 90% deployed). Feb 16 he had a "gentle reset session" where he acknowledged cognitive debt and wrote explicit weekly plans with a NOT list. The commitment mapping session (Feb 15) revealed he's running 14 active commitments across 5 tiers, with Tier 1 (life/relationships) undertended while Tier 3 (creative projects) gets most energy. Self-assessed at 70/30 work/life instead of target 50/50.

**The recovery strategy:** This week is intentionally constrained — polish only, no building. He's protecting against his pattern of infrastructure obsession.

## BUSINESS (Chez Julien / Operation Autonomy)

**Recent massive build (Feb 16-17):** Staffing Calendar System went from code to 90% deployed in one day. Cloudflare Worker + dashboard + Google Calendar bidirectional sync. Julien's availability now auto-syncs from his dedicated Google Calendar. Red day flagging (understaffing alerts) operational. 2-month lookahead feature built Feb 17. System generates WhatsApp-ready planning text.

**What's left:** 15 minutes of work to set 5 environment variables + cron trigger, then end-to-end testing. Deliberately paused — not doing it this week per his NOT list.

**Team status:**
- **Henry** — Full-time, 24 years old. Doing good work, wants manager role. Development path being designed.
- **Lucas** — Part-time, best friends with Henry. Good with customers, strategically disengaged from cognitive work.
- **Jeanne** — New column added to staffing system Feb 16 (waiting on internship schedule).

**The Big Meeting** — Was planned for Saturday Feb 14 (mentioned in modified files), but no activity log entry confirms it happened. Status unclear.

**Operation mode:** Still in Operation Autonomy (transform shop to run without Julien's daily involvement). Previous mode was Operation Exit (selling) — archived after deciding not to sell. Henry development is the key path forward.

## TOOLS & STACK

**Current AI setup:**

- **Primary:** Claude (via Cowork and direct sessions like this one)
- **Machines:** Mac Mini (16GB, primary) + MacBook Pro 2019 (8GB Intel, secondary for background tasks)
- **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare Workers, Notion (heavy operational use), Supabase, Resend (newsletter), Google Calendar API (service account auth)
- **Recent builds:** Staffing dashboard (HTML + Worker proxy), automated subscriber pipeline (Zapier/Activepieces), 2-month lookahead with Belgian holiday calculation

**Letta agents (built Feb 15, not mentioned in context note):**
- Brain, Coach, Queue — 3 persistent agents with shared memory blocks
- Hold commitment map, session log, project states
- Next step was Letta ↔ MylifeOS sync via Cloudflare Worker, but this is explicitly on the NOT list this week

**PRISM challenge:** Needs 10x token expansion (90k → 900k). He identifies the real problem as "finding what to ask of it" — not a technical limit, but a conceptual one about how to use that capacity.

## LIFE

**Lucia:** Girlfriend, artist. Quitting her job May 1, 2026 to go self-employed (teaching + selling art). Julien needs to support her with time and money through the transition. Meeting anniversary: 27th of each month (yesterday, Feb 17). Yearly anniversary: April 27. Birthday: Jan 13.

**Poncho:** Australian Shepherd, 2.5 years old. Julien has a new leash design idea for him (ties into new physical product interest).

**Physical product interest (NEW):** Wants to explore building furniture and physical products. Planning to explore how AI can help with design and fabrication. This is a genuine new direction, not just a passing idea.

**Household dynamics:** Lucia "wouldn't accept" a second monitor on Julien's desk (from Feb 12 Mac setup analysis). Space is constrained. Physical environment matters.

**Energy state:** Coming off a crash. Feb 16 daily note called it "Path B — gentle reset" after acknowledging cognitive debt. Weekly plans written with explicit constraints. He's in recovery, not expansion mode.

**Key insight from Feb 16:** "Whatever I can build today will be shit compared to what I can build in 6 months. What matters today is learning the skills that will matter in 6 months and the next decade."

## UPCOMING DATES

- **Sunday Feb 23** — Public launch of both blogs + game publication deadline
- **May 1, 2026** — Lucia quits her job (75 days away)
- **Feb 27** — Monthly anniversary with Lucia (9 days)
