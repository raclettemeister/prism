# LIFE CONTEXT SNAPSHOT — Julien
**Generated:** 2026-02-26

---

## 1. Right Now

Julien is in a quiet, consolidation mode today — no major changes, no new sessions logged. His primary mental focus is on **The Cockpit**: his settled working environment of Cursor + Superpowers skill set + custom skills and rules. He's satisfied with it as a current solution but remains actively hunting for improvements. Mood is calm and pragmatic — the blog delay is a non-issue for him.

---

## 2. This Week — Active Projects & Status

**🛠️ The Cockpit (HOT)**
- Settled on: Cursor + Superpowers + custom skills/rules as his AI working environment
- Known friction points: some things still get implemented automatically without his control; hard to run multiple passes on the same reasoning chain
- Actively watching for a better architecture — framing it explicitly as a "cockpit" (helicopter analogy: correct sequences → good output, not just vibing with an LLM)
- Recent file activity (Feb 23): Cursor config README, first-week cheatsheet, superpowers-vs-cockpit comparison doc all refined

**📝 Blog — julien.care (WARM, DELAYED)**
- Launch delayed by a few days — Julien is fine with it, no stress
- Not the active focus this week

**🎮 RenPy Game (WARM, POSTPONED)**
- Exciting but explicitly postponed for at least a week
- Current thinking: use the pause to design the right cockpit/workflow *before* touching RenPy — not jumping in blind
- No files touched this week

**🎵 Mixtapes Project (ACTIVE — last touched Feb 23)**
- Four entries refined Feb 23: Jazz Mess Around, Woodstock, Queen Live, Buena Vista Social Club
- STATUS.md updated — this is quietly moving

**💃 Dancing / Lindy Hop (INFRASTRUCTURE ACTIVE)**
- Dancing session skill (`.cursor/skills/dancing-session/SKILL.md`) recently modified — full coaching system built and refined
- No session logged this week yet, but the system is ready and maintained

**🎸 Guitar Coach (INFRASTRUCTURE ACTIVE)**
- Guitar coach skill recently modified — full system built
- No session noted this week

**🏪 Shop Sale Research (UPCOMING)**
- Julien plans a deep research push to find prospects for selling the retail shop
- Focus: chains and centralized kitchens
- One warm lead already: a multi-cheese place owner is interested
- Not started yet — flagged as upcoming work

**🪑 Physical Products / Making (INTEREST-LEVEL)**
- Furniture building, new leash design for Poncho
- Exploring how AI can assist physical design + 3D printing
- No active files — exploratory thinking only

## 3. Priorities & Struggles

**What matters most this week:**
- Maintaining and refining The Cockpit — it's his core productivity lever
- Thinking through the RenPy game cockpit *before* building (meta-work before object-level work)
- Beginning prospect research for shop sale

**What's hard:**
- The Cockpit still has automation he didn't ask for (things getting implemented without explicit approval)
- Can't easily run multiple reasoning passes on the same problem inside Cursor — single-pass thinking is the current ceiling
- This is a known limitation he's living with while watching for better solutions

**What he's NOT doing this week:**
- RenPy game creation (explicitly postponed)
- Blog launch (delayed, not urgent)
- No deep business operations work flagged

## 4. Business — Chez Julien

**Strategic direction: Operation Autonomy** (push shop to run without Julien → passive income while he pursues other things). Previous plan was Operation Exit (sell); current plan is autonomy-first, with sale as fallback.

**Shop sale parallel track:** Julien is now also actively pursuing a sale — running both tracks simultaneously. Deep prospect research coming soon. Warm lead exists (multi-cheese place owner).

**Team:**
- **Henry** (full-time) — being developed toward managing/operating role. Key person for autonomy strategy. 24 years old, invested but needs structure and experience.
- **Lucas** (part-time/quasi-full-time) — good with customers, sales focus. Relationship dynamic being managed carefully.
- Feb 4 team meeting happened — foundation-laying meeting, soft manager pitch to Henry, fair-deal framing for Lucas. Big Meeting (full role restructure) planned for ~March 2026.

**Software tools:** Staffing Calendar System is built and deployed (Cloudflare Worker + Notion + Google Calendar). Setup guide and test-run docs exist. System syncs Julien's availability, detects red days, sends ntfy alerts. Status: deployed, likely operational — no active dev work flagged this week.

**Operation Autonomy status:** Setup & Planning phase, started February 2026. Several expected subfolders (01_Strategy, 02_Henry_Development, 04_Processes, 06_Metrics) may not exist yet per the reference file's own flags.

## 5. Tools & Stack

| Layer | Current Choice |
|---|---|
| **Primary AI cockpit** | Cursor + Superpowers extension |
| **Skill/rules system** | Custom `.cursor/skills/` — Julien-authored skills (dancing, guitar, business status, value plan, weekly business plan) |
| **Business backend** | Notion (staffing database) + Cloudflare Workers (staffing sync) + Google Calendar |
| **Notifications** | ntfy (`mylifeos-business` topic) |
| **Life OS** | MyLifeOS — markdown files, CLAUDE.md / CURRENT.md / LOG.md architecture |
| **AI approach** | LLM as execution; Julien as direction + judgment. Cockpit metaphor = structured sequences, not vibe prompting |

**Known cockpit weaknesses being tolerated:**
- Auto-implementation without confirmation
- Single-pass reasoning ceiling
- Actively evaluating alternatives (always on the lookout)

## 6. Life

**Lucia:**
- Quitting her job May 1, 2026 to go self-employed (art teaching + selling her art)
- Julien explicitly committed to supporting her with time and money through this transition
- This is a major life context shaping everything — it's part of why autonomy/sale of the shop matters

**Poncho:**
- Australian Shepherd, ~2.5 years old
- New leash design is one of Julien's physical product interests (hobby-level, not urgent)

**Energy/mood today:**
- Quiet. Settled. Not in high-output mode.
- No stress signals. Blog delay = fine. RenPy delay = intentional.
- Feels like a thinking/consolidation day, not a building day.

**Upcoming dates of note:**
- Lucia's job exit: May 1, 2026
- Big Team Meeting (Henry/Lucas restructure): ~March 2026
- Monthly anniversary with Lucia: 27th of each month (next: Feb 27 — tomorrow)
