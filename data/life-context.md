# Julien — Life Context Snapshot
> Auto-updated before each PRISM run. Last updated: 2026-02-14

## Who I Am
Julien, 31. Founder/owner of GPFC srl (Chez Julien — specialty food shop, Brussels). Transitioning to AI software developer. Zero coding background — builds everything with Claude Code, Cursor, and AI assistance. Goal: become "a software developer who never codes."

## Current Season: AI Exploration + Blog Launch (Jan-May 2026)
High-energy exploration phase. Blog and game are LIVE. Polishing for public launch Feb 23.
Lucia (girlfriend) quitting her job May 1 to go self-employed (art). Need to support her transition.
Self-assessed at 70% work / 30% life instead of target 50/50.

## Active Projects (Priority Order)
1. **PRISM** — Personal research intelligence system. V0 just shipped. Runs nightly on GitHub Actions. Needs: embedded sources, life context awareness, tool recommendations.
2. **Operation Autonomy** — Making Chez Julien run without me. Key person: Henry (24, full-time, needs mentoring to become manager). Sub-projects: staffing dashboard, ordering assistant, process documentation.
3. **Blog / julien.care** — Live. Weekly bilingual (FR+EN). Newsletter via Resend + Supabase. Public launch Feb 23.
4. **Chez Julien Simulator** — Video game, live at julien.care/game. Grand opening with family tonight (Feb 14).
5. **Sweden Odyssey** — Video game about a trip with ~20 friends. First project where I learn to code. GitHub collab.
6. **Information Digest** — Personalized news system. Being absorbed into PRISM.
7. **Research Center** — Knowledge base for AI/tech intelligence. Houses PRISM.

## Current Tech Stack
- **Primary workstation:** Mac Mini 16GB — Cursor + Claude Cowork
- **Secondary station:** MacBook Pro 2019 8GB — second Cowork instance for background tasks
- **AI tools:** Claude API (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus), Cursor, Claude Code, Lovable
- **Infrastructure:** GitHub, Supabase, Cloudflare Workers, Vercel
- **Languages:** JavaScript/Node.js (learning), HTML/CSS
- **No experience with:** Python, Rust, Go, databases beyond Supabase

## Current Challenges
- Learning to manage AI at scale — packaging work into AI-delegatable chunks
- Running parallel AI sessions across both machines
- Building long-running tasks that keep AI busy while I do other things
- Making Henry autonomous enough to manage the shop
- Maintaining work/life balance (disciplines and dancing have slipped)

## What I'm Learning Right Now
- Agentic AI and autonomous agents
- Prompt engineering → context engineering
- Management and mentoring (for Henry)
- Node.js and software architecture (through building)

## Budget
- AI spending: unlimited for now (prioritizing capability over cost)
- May change as I learn what actually delivers value
- Current subscriptions: Claude Pro, Cursor Pro, likely adding more

## Key Dates Coming Up
- Feb 14 (today): Valentine's Day. Game evening with family. Big team meeting prep.
- Feb 23: Public launch of blog + game
- May 1: Lucia quits her job — need financial buffer ready
